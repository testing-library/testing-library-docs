<summary>我应该使用哪个 get 方法？</summary>

<summary>我能用这个库来编写单元测试吗？</summary>

绝对可以！你可以使用该库编写单元、集成和端到端测试。

在编写测试时，请牢记：

  如果应用或页面使用了国际化，无法在测试中获取到对应的文本，该怎么办？
</summary>

This is fairly common. Our first bit of advice is to try to get the default text
used in your tests. That will make everything much easier (more than just using
this utility). If that's not possible, then you're probably best to just stick
with `data-testid`s (which is not bad anyway).

<summary>
  真心不喜欢使用 data-testids，但是其它的查询方式又感觉不合适，
  一定要使用 data-testid 吗?
</summary>

Definitely not. That said, a common reason people don't like the `data-testid`
attribute is they're concerned about shipping that to production. I'd suggest
that you probably want some simple E2E tests that run in production on occasion
to make certain that things are working smoothly. In that case the `data-testid`
attributes will be very useful. Even if you don't run these in production, you
may want to run some E2E tests that run on the same code you're about to ship to
production. In that case, the `data-testid` attributes will be valuable there as
well.

All that said, if you really don't want to ship `data-testid` attributes, then
you can use
[this simple babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-remove-properties)
to remove them.

If you don't want to use them at all, then you can simply use regular DOM
methods and properties to query elements off your container.

```javascript
const firstLiInDiv = container.querySelector('div li')
const allLisInDiv = container.querySelectorAll('div li')
const rootElement = container.firstChild
```

<summary>
  如果在一个列表中为每一项都添加了 data-testid="item" 属性，怎么样区分它们？
</summary>

You can make your selector just choose the one you want by including :nth-child
in the selector.

```javascript
const thirdLiInUl = container.querySelector('ul > li:nth-child(3)')
```

Or you could use `getAllByRole` to query the `listitem` role and access the
index in question:

```javascript
const items = [
  /* your items */
]
const {container} = render(/* however you render this stuff */)
const thirdItem = getAllByRole(container, 'listitem')[2]
```

<summary>
  求救! 无法访问组件的方法或组件实例!
</summary>

This is **intentional**.

We want you to focus on testing the output and functionality of the component as
it is observed by the user and to **avoid worrying about the implementation
details** of the component.

We believe this leads to less brittle and more meaningful test code.

Please refer to the [Guiding Principles](guiding-principles.mdx) of this testing
library for more info.
