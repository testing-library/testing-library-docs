对于不针对 Vue 测试的问题，也请参见[主要的FAQ](dom-testing-library/faq.mdx)。

<details>
  <summary>Vue Testing Library 是官方 @vue/test-utils的替代品吗？</summary>

Short answer: yes, it is. If you use Vue Testing Library (VTL) there's no need
to install [@vue/test-utils][vue-test-utils].

Longer answer: VTL is built on top of @vue/test-utils. The official library is
used to render Vue components (by calling [`mount`][mount]) and exposes some of
its methods (while hiding others). You can check the full list of available
methods in the [API](vue-testing-library/api.mdx) section.

<details>
  <summary>我需要安装 DOM Testing Library 吗?</summary>

Nope! VTL imports everything it needs from DOM Testing Library, and then
re-exports it.

</details>

<details>
  <summary> Vue Testing Library 提供哪些查询?</summary>

All queries from DOM Testing Library. See [Queries](queries/about.mdx) for full
list.

  <summary>如果我不能使用浅层渲染，我如何在测试中模拟出组件？</summary>

In general, you should avoid mocking out components (see
[the Guiding Principles section](guiding-principles.mdx)).

However if you need to, you can either use Jest's
[mocking feature](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/manual-mocks.html) or
the [`stubs`][stubs] key provided by @vue/test-utils.

```js
import {render} from '@testing-library/vue'
import Component from './Component'

test('Can stub components', () => {
  render(Component, {
    stubs: ['FontAwesomeIcon'],
  })
})
```

You can check out a [working example][stubs-example] in the GitHub repository of
VTL.

<details>
  <summary>我如何测试一个元素是否出现/消失了？</summary>

Check the [Appearance and Disappearance](guide-disappearance.mdx) section of the
Guide for available methods to test appearance and disappearance.

If you want to check if an element was never rendered, you might want to write
something like the following:

```js
expect(queryByText('submit')).toBeNull()

// or, if using jest-dom:
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
expect(queryByText('submit')).not.toBeInTheDocument()
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>为什么我的Vue Router状态似乎在测试之间被共享？</summary>

By default, Vue Router uses
[`hash` routing mode](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#mode), which stores route
updates in `window.location`. Test runners, such as Jest, do not reset the JSDOM
environment in between test invocations, so route transitions from previous
tests can leak into subsequent tests, even though a new Vue Router is created
with each call to `render`.

To work around this issue, pass an instantiated router using `abstract` mode.
`abstract` mode does not store route information on the JSDOM `window`, so
routing information will not leak between tests. For example:

```js
import {render} from '@testing-library/vue'
import Component from './Component.vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

test('uses abstract mode for the router', async () => {
  const router = new VueRouter({
    mode: 'abstract',
    routes: [
      // Your routes here
    ],
  })

  const renderResult = render(Component, {
    routes: router,
  })

  // Unlike the router in `hash` mode, the initial routing stack is empty. So,
  // you need to push an initial route to the stack.
  await router.push('/')
})
```

To reduce boilerplate, you can create a custom render function to use throughout
your test suite. For example:

```js
// test-utils.js

import {render} from '@testing-library/vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

export async function renderApp(component, options) {
  const router = new VueRouter({
    mode: 'abstract',
    routes: [
      // Your routes here
    ],
  })

  const renderResult = render(component, {
    routes: router,
    ...options,
  })

  // Unlike the router in `hash` mode, the initial routing stack is empty. So,
  // you need to push an initial route to the stack.
  await router.push('/')

  return renderResult
}
```
