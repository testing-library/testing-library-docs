We have a docs site now! It's built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

The new site is the homepage for DOM Testing Library, React Testing Library, and
the \*-testing-library ecosystem. Check out the landing pages for each:

- [🐙 DOM Testing Library][dtl]
- [⚛️ React Testing Library][rtl]
- [🌲 Cypress Testing Library][ctl]

💯 Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the docs over the past months -
the content has been ported over and the hope is that this site will provide a
centralized place for examples, API reference, and community links in 2019 and
beyond!

🎉 Happy new year!

[rtl]: /docs/react-testing-library/intro
[ctl]: /docs/cypress-testing-library/intro
