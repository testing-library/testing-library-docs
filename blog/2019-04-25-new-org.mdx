Hello friends! I'm pleased to announce the recent updates to the testing-library
family of tools! As always, we're committed to giving you the best tools to
enable you to have confidence in shipping your applications. That's why the
guiding principle for everything we do is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

This guiding principle has given us direction and we've been able to accomplish
a lot in the testing space. To further our mission, I'd like to make a few
announcements about changes going on in the testing-library world.

## [dom-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library) v4 released!

This is actually a pretty small release, but I think it's worth mentioning
anyway. We try to keep breaking changes to a minimum. This release only has two
breaking changes. One is removal of deprecated methods you probably weren't
using anyway, and the other reveals potential bugs in your tests. So you should
be able to upgrade to this version with little-to-no effort.

If you do experience breakages, it's probably due to something like this:

<!-- prettier in my editor treats this like MDX, which turns this into a
self-closing tag. But the parser docusaurus uses doesn't like that so we'll
just disable it here -->
<!-- prettier-ignore -->

  style={{width: '100%', height:500, border:0, borderRadius: 4, overflow:'hidden'}}   sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"

We hope that this helps you catch bugs better!

[react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
and
[cypress-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library)
have already been updated and released major version bumps of their own to
account for this upgrade. Other wrappers will hopefully follow shortly based on
their respective matinainers' schedules.

## [Testing Library on GitHub](https://github.com/testing-library)

We've created a new org on GitHub to manage the family of testing library
projects. The best part of the "Testing Library" isn't the code, but the
philosophy behind it. So we're using the organization as a way to group all the
projects that share the same philosophy and general utilities so whether you're
using Vue, Cypress, or React (Native), you'll have a super testing tool that
you're familiar with.

Here are the current (or soon to be) members of the org:

- [dom-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library)
- [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
- [cypress-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library)
- [vue-testing-library](https://github.com/dfcook/vue-testing-library)
- [native-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/native-testing-library)
  (React Native)
- [pptr-testing-library](https://github.com/patrickhulce/pptr-testing-library)
  (Puppeteer)
- [bs-react-testing-library](https://github.com/wyze/bs-react-testing-library)
  (ReasonReact)
- [testcafe-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/testcafe-testing-library)
- [user-event](https://github.com/Gpx/user-event)
- [jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)
- [jest-native](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-native)

(Hopefully we'll have
[angular on there eventually](https://github.com/angular-extensions/testing-library/issues/4)
[as well as ember](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/327)).

What's cool is that building wrappers for your JavaScript framework of choice is
often quite simple (as I demonstrate on
[TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com)). And as mentioned below,
you can carry these same principles to non-DOM platforms as well!

## [Testing Library on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/testing-library)

If the Testing Library family of tools has provided you any value at all, we'd
encourage you (or your employer) to contribute to our new
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/testing-library).

It is intended that funds raised by this open collective be used to:

- Donate to charities and other good causes
- Purchase testing-library related merchandise (stickers, T-Shirts, etc).
- Pay for hosting/domains/etc.

There are currently no plans to pay people who work on the project, but we
reserve the right to do so if it makes sense in the future.

> [Contribute to our open collective](https://opencollective.com/testing-library)

## [Testing Library on Twitter](https://twitter.com/testinglib)

A lot of chatter is going on in the Testing Library world on Twitter, so we've
created a twitter account you can follow and keep up with what's going on.

> [Follow @TestingLib](https://twitter.com/testinglib)

## [Testing Library on Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/testing-library)

We've had a pretty active spectrum community for react-testing-library. We're in
the process of moving that to a more general Testing Library spectrum so we can
have all discussion around the different wrappers in one place. There are over
600 members of our spectrum community (special shout-out to
[Giorgio](https://spectrum.chat/users/gpx) who has been SUPER helpful to people
there.) Please join us!

## [Testing Library on React Native](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/)

I'm really happy to announce a super solution to the React Native testing space.
The DOM is quite different from native, as I mentioned before, it's not the code
but the concepts that really make the Testing Library great. I'm happy to say
that [Brandon Carroll](https://github.com/bcarroll22) has successfully ported
those concepts to a solution for React Native and I'm really happy with it. Give
it a look if you're building React Native applications and want confidence that
they continue to work as you make changes!

## [Learn Testing Library](/docs/learning)

There's been a LOT of activity around the Testing Library principles and tools
in the content space. We do have
[a page that lists learning materials](/docs/learning), and more gets added to
it daily. If you know of blog posts, YouTube videos, courses, or anything else
about the Testing Library family of tools, please contribute to the list!

## Other Exciting news

As of a few months ago,
[the React team officially recommends](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)
you use react-testing-library to test your react applications. That's kinda neat
:)

At the React Amsterdam [Open Source awards](https://osawards.com/react/)
ceremony, react-testing-library won the award for the Most impactful
contribution to the community!

![Open Source Awards award](/img/blog/award.jpg)

react-testing-library _also_ received recognition on the
[ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks)
as technology they believe is "Worth exploring with the goal of understanding
how it will affect your enterprise." We think so too :)

## Special Thank You

Each of the projects has had many contributors and on most projects in
[the org](https://github.com/testing-library), you'll find a table of
contributors. We're super grateful for all the contributions people have made to
the projects. I'd like to also give a special shout-out to people who have made
an especially significant impact on the Testing Library family of tools and
community.

[Myself ðŸ‘‹](https://kentcdodds.com), [Alex Krolick](https://alexkrolick.com/),
[Brandon Carroll](https://github.com/bcarroll22),
[Giorgio](https://twitter.com/Gpx),
[Ernesto GarcÃ­a](https://twitter.com/gnapse), and
[Daniel Cook](https://github.com/dfcook).

As I said, there have been many who have contributed a great deal to the
community, but these people stand out to me as individuals who have done
especially great work. Thank you!

## Conclusion

No matter what platform you're working with, the guiding principles of the
Testing Library family can be applied to the tests for that platform. Take a
step back and consider how closely your tests are resembling the way your
software is used. If you can, consider what lightweight but powerful utilities
would enable others to test their software in that way as well and create a
library for that! Maybe it can join the Testing Library family of tools!
