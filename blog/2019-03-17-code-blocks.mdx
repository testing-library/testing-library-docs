Many of the code samples have been updated to include tabs to switch between
"plain" DOM Testing Library syntax and the wrappers for React, Cypress, etc.

Thanks to [@tylerthehaas](https://github.com/tylerthehaas) for pointing out that
the previous examples could be confusing if you were targeting a specific
library, and to the Docusaurus team for adding support for code tabs in version
[1.7.2](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170---2019-1-23).
