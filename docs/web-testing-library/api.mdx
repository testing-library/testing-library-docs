Several utilities are provided for dealing with asynchronous code. These can be
useful to wait for an element to appear or disappear in response to an event,
user action, timeout, or Promise. (See the
[guide to testing disappearance](guide-disappearance.mdx).)

The async methods return Promises, so be sure to use `await` or `.then` when
calling them.

## `waitFor`

```typescript
function waitFor<T>(
  callback: () => T | Promise<T>,
  options?: {
    interval?: number
    onTimeout?: (error: Error) => Error
    showOriginalStackTrace?: boolean
    signal?: AbortSignal
    timeout?: number
  },
): Promise<T>
```

When in need to wait for any period of time you can use `waitFor`, to wait for
your expectations to pass. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
// ...
// Wait until the callback does not throw an error. In this case, that means
// it'll wait until the mock function has been called once.
await waitFor(() => expect(mockAPI).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1))
// ...
```

`waitFor` may run the callback a number of times until the timeout is reached.
Note that the number of calls is constrained by the `timeout` and `interval`
options.

This can be useful if you have a unit test that mocks API calls and you need to
wait for your mock promises to all resolve.

If you return a promise in the `waitFor` callback (either explicitly or
implicitly with the `async` syntax), then the `waitFor` utility does not call
your callback again until that promise rejects. This allows you to `waitFor`
things that must be checked asynchronously.

The default `interval` is `50ms`. However, it runs your callback
immediatelybefore starting the intervals.

The `onTimeout` callback receives the error with which `waitFor` should reject.
You can return a more detailed error with which `waitFor` should reject. For
example, in a DOM you can return a snapshot of the DOM at the time `waitFor`
timed out.

You can pass an
[`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) if
you want `waitFor` to stop checking the callback (e.g. if you want it to race
against other observers like
[`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver/MutationObserver)).
`waitFor` will then reject with the
[`reason` of the given `AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal/reason).

By default, `waitFor` will reject with the stack trace of the `waitFor` call.
This is usually the more relevant stack trace for developers. However, you might
want to trace the last call to the given `callback` that caused `waitFor` to
reject. Then you can pass `showOriginalStackTrace: true`. We don't recommend
using it unless you know what you're doing.

The default `timeout` is `1000ms`.
