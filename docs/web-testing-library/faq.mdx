<summary>Why "Web" in "Web Testing Library</summary>

This library implements testing utilities that are used on different runtimes
implementing the
[Minimum Common Web Platform API](https://proposal-common-min-api.deno.dev/) (or
parts of it). This includes browsers, Node.js, Deno, React Native and others
(the [runtime keys](https://runtime-keys.proposal.wintercg.org/#react-native)
contains known runtimes). The name is born out of pragmatism. A more precise
name would be "Web-interoperable runtimes Testing Library".
