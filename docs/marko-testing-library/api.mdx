`Marko Testing Library` re-exports everything from `DOM Testing Library` as well
as these methods:

- [`render`](#render)
  - [`render` Options](#render-options)
    - [`container`](#container)
- [`render` Result](#render-result)
  - [`...queries`](#queries)

  - [`emitted`](#emitted)
  - [`cleanup`](#cleanup)
  - [`container`](#container-1)

## `render`

```javascript
function render(
  template, // A Marko template to render
  input, // Input for the above template
  options // You won't often use this, expand below for docs on options
)
```

Render into a container which is appended to `document.body`.

```javascript
import {render} from '@marko/testing-library'
import MyTemplate from './my-template.marko'

render(MyTemplate)
```

```javascript
import {render, screen} from '@marko/testing-library'
import Greeting from './greeting.marko'

test('renders a message', async () => {
  const {container} = await render(Greeting, {name: 'Marko'})
  expect(screen.getByText(/Marko/)).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(container.firstChild).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    <h1>Hello, Marko!</h1>
  `)
})
```

### `render` Options

You won't often need to specify options, but if you ever do, here are the
available options which you can provide as the third argument to `render`.

#### `container`

By default for client-side tests, `Marko Testing Library` will create a `div`
and append that `div` to the `document.body` and this is where your component
will be rendered. If you provide your own HTMLElement `container` via this
option, it will not be appended to the `document.body` automatically.

For example: If you are unit testing a `tablebody` element, it cannot be a child
of a `div`. In this case, you can specify a `table` as the render `container`.

```javascript
const table = document.createElement('table')

const {container} = await render(MyTableBody, null, {
  container: document.body.appendChild(table),
})
```

## `render` Result

The `render` method returns a promise which resolves with an object that has a
few properties:

### `...queries`

The most important feature of `render` is that the queries from
[the Core API](queries/about.mdx) are automatically returned with their first
argument bound to the results of rendering your component.

See [Queries](queries/about.mdx#types-of-queries) for a complete list.

**Example**

```javascript
const {getByLabelText, queryAllByTestId} = await render(MyTemplate)
```

Alternatively, you can use the
[top-level `screen` method](queries/about.mdx#screen) to query into all
currently rendered components in the `document.body`, eg:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from "@marko/testing-library"

await render(MyTemplate)
const el = screen.getByText(...)
```

### `debug`

This method is a shortcut for logging the `prettyDOM` for all children inside of
the `container`.

```javascript
import {render} from '@marko/testing-library'
import Greeting from './greeting.marko'

const {debug} = await render(Greeting, {name: 'World'})
debug()

// <h1>Hello World</h1>
// you can also pass an element: debug(getByTestId('messages'))
```

This is a simple wrapper around `prettyDOM` which is also exposed and comes from
[`DOM Testing Library`](dom-testing-library/api-debugging.mdx#prettydom).

### `rerender`

A Marko components `input` can change at any time from a parent component.
Although often this input is passed through your component declaratively,
sometimes it is necessary to ensure that your components react appropriately to
new data. You can simulate your component receiving new `input` by passing new
data to the `rerender` helper.

```javascript
import {render} from '@marko/testing-library'
import Greeting from './greeting.marko'

const {rerender, debug} = await render(Greeting, {name: 'World'})

// re-render the same component with different props
await rerender({name: 'Marko'})

debug()
// <h1>Hello Marko</h1>
```

### `emitted`

Marko components also communicate with their parents through events. It is
recommended to also test that your components emit the right events at the right
time.

The `emitted` helper does just that. Calling the helper will return all emitted
events since the last call to the helper. You can also pass in an event type to
filter the results.

```javascript
import {render, fireEvent} from '@marko/testing-library'
import Counter from './counter.marko'

const {getByText, emitted} = await render(Counter)

const button = getByText('Increment')

await fireEvent.click(button)
await fireEvent.click(button)

// Assuming the `Counter` component forwards these button clicks as `increment` events
expect(emitted('increment')).toHaveProperty('length', 2)

await fireEvent.click(button)

// Note: the tracked events are cleared every time you read them.
// Below we are snapshoting the events after our last assertion,
// the return value will include an array with all of the arguments for each increment event.
expect(emitted('increment')).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    Array [
      Array [
        Object {
          "count": 3,
        },
      ],
    ]
`)

// Without an event type will give you all events with their type and arguments.
expect(emitted()).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    Array [
      Object {
        "args": Array [
          Object {
            "count": 0,
          },
        ],
        "type": "increment",
      },
      Object {
        "args": Array [
          Object {
            "count": 1,
          },
        ],
        "type": "increment",
      },
      Object {
        "args": Array [
          Object {
            "count": 3,
          },
        ],
        "type": "increment",
      }
    ]
  `)
```

### `cleanup`

Like the [top-level cleanup method](#cleanup-1), this allows you to remove and
destroy the currently rendered component before the test has been completed.

This can be useful to validate that a component properly cleans up any DOM
mutations once it has been destroyed.

```javascript
import {render, screen, getRoles} from '@marko/testing-library'
import Main from './main.marko'
import Dialog from './dialog.marko'

await render(Main)

const main = screen.getByRole('main')
expect(main).not.toHaveAttribute('aria-hidden')

const {cleanup} = await render(Dialog)
expect(main).toHaveAttribute('aria-hidden') // assert added attribute

cleanup() // destroy the dialog

expect(main).not.toHaveAttribute('aria-hidden') // assert attribute removed
```

### `container`

The containing DOM node of your rendered Marko Component. For server-side tests
this is a [JSDOM.fragment](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom#fragment), and for
client-side tests this will be whatever is passed as the `container` render
option.

> Tip: To get the root element of your rendered element, use
> `container.firstChild`.

> 🚨 If you find yourself using `container` to query for rendered elements then
> you should reconsider! The other queries are designed to be more resilient to
> changes that will be made to the component you're testing. Avoid using
> `container` to query for elements!

## `fireEvent`

Because Marko batches DOM updates to avoid unnecessary re-renders, the
[fireEvent](dom-testing-library/api-events.mdx) helpers are re-exported as
`async` functions. Awaiting this ensures that the DOM has properly updated in
response to the event triggered in the test.

```js
await fireEvent.click(getByText('Click me'))
```

## `cleanup`

With client-side tests your components are rendered into a placeholder
HTMLElement. To ensure that your components are properly removed, and destroyed,
after each test the `cleanup` method is called for you automatically by hooking
into `afterEach` in supported test frameworks. You can also manually call
`cleanup` at any time which will remove all attached components.

```javascript
import {render, cleanup, screen} from '@marko/testing-library'
import Greeting from './greeting.marko'

await render(Greeting, {name: 'Marko'})

expect(screen.getByText(/Marko/)).toBeInTheDocument()

// manually cleanup the component before the test is finished
cleanup()
expect(screen.queryByText(/Marko/)).toBeNull()
```

You can turn off the automatic test cleanup by importing the following module:

```javascript
import '@marko/testing-library/dont-cleanup-after-each'
```

With mocha you can use
`mocha --require @marko/testing-library/dont-cleanup-after-each` as a shorthand.

If you are using Jest, you can include
`setupFilesAfterEnv: ["@marko/testing-library/dont-cleanup-after-each"]` in your
Jest config to avoid doing this in each file.
