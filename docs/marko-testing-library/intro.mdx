[`Marko Testing Library`](https://github.com/marko-js/testing-library) builds on
top of [`DOM Testing Library`](dom-testing-library/intro.mdx) by adding APIs for
working with Marko components.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @marko/testing-library
```

## The problem

You want to write maintainable tests for your Marko components. As a part of
this goal, you want your tests to avoid including implementation details of your
components and rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence for
which they are intended. As part of this, you want your test suite to be
maintainable in the long run so refactors of your components (changes to
implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and
your team down.

## This solution

The `@marko/testing-library` is a very lightweight solution for testing Marko
components. It provides light utility functions on top of
[`@testing-library/dom`](dom-testing-library/intro.mdx) in a way that encourages
better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](guiding-principles.mdx)

So rather than dealing with instances of rendered Marko components, your tests
will work with actual DOM nodes. The utilities this library provides facilitate
querying the DOM in the same way the user would. Finding for elements by their
label text (just like a user would), finding links and buttons from their text
(like a user would). It contains a small targeted API and can get out of your
way if needed with some built-in escape hatches.

This library encourages your applications to be more accessible and allows you
to get your tests closer to using your components the way a user will, which
allows your tests to give you more confidence that your application will work
when a real user uses it.

**What this library is not**:

1.  A test runner or framework
2.  Specific to a testing framework, you can [use it with Jest](setup.mdx#jest),
    [mocha](setup.mdx#mocha), or other test runners.

> NOTE: This library is built on top of
> [`DOM Testing Library`](dom-testing-library/intro.mdx) which is where most of
> the logic behind the queries is.
