`Marko Testing Library` is not dependent on any test runner. However, it is
dependent on the test environment. This package works for testing both server
side, and client-side Marko templates and provides a slightly different
implementation optimized for each. This is done using a
[browser shim](https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec),
just like in Marko.

The [browser shim](https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec)
is picked up by many tools, including all bundlers and some test runners.

Below is some example configurations to test both server and browser components
with some popular test runners.

### [Jest](http://jestjs.io)

For Jest to understand Marko templates you must first
[install the @marko/jest preset](https://github.com/marko-js/jest#installation).
This allows your Marko templates to be imported into your tests.

In Jest there is a
[browser option](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#browser-boolean) which
will tell Jest to resolve the
[browser shim](https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec)
version of all modules as mentioned above.

To test components rendered on the client-side, be sure to enable both the
`browser` option and the preset and you are good to go!

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  preset: '@marko/jest/preset/browser',
}
```

For testing components rendered on the server-side we can instead use
`@marko/jest/preset/node` as our jest preset.

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  preset: '@marko/jest/preset/node',
}
```

A Jest configuration can also have multiple
[projects](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#projects-array-string-projectconfig)
which we can use to create a combined configuration for server-side tests, and
client-side tests, like so:

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  projects: [
    {
      displayName: 'server',
      preset: '@marko/jest/preset/node',
      testRegex: '/__tests__/[^.]+\\.server\\.js$',
    },
    {
      displayName: 'browser',
      preset: '@marko/jest/preset/browser',
      testRegex: '/__tests__/[^.]+\\.browser\\.js$',
    },
  ],
}
```

### [Mocha](https://mochajs.org)

Mocha also works great for testing Marko components. Mocha, however, has no
understanding of
[browser shims](https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec)
which means out of the box it can only work with server-side Marko components.

To run server-side Marko tests with `mocha` you can simply run the following
command:

```console
mocha --require marko/node-require
```

This enables the
[Marko require hook](https://markojs.com/docs/installing/#require-marko-views)
and allows you to require server-side Marko templates directly in your tests.

For client-side testing of your components with Mocha often you will use a
bundler to build your tests (this will properly resolve the browser shims
mentioned above) and then you can load these tests in some kind of browser
context.
