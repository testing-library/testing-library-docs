When users interact in the browser by e.g. pressing keyboard keys, they interact
with a UI layer the browser shows to them. The browser then interprets this
input, possibly alters the underlying DOM accordingly and dispatches
[trusted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted)
events.  
The UI layer and trusted events are not programmatically available.  
Therefore `user-event` has to apply workarounds and mock the UI layer to
simulate user interactions like they would happen in the browser.

## Starting a session per `setup()`

```ts
setup(options?: Options): UserEvent
```

The `userEvent.setup()` API applies these workarounds to the document and allows
you to [configure](options.mdx) an "instance" of `user-event`.  
Methods on this instance share one input device state, e.g. which keys are
pressed.

This allows to write multiple consecutive interactions that behave just like the
described interactions by a real user.

```js
const user = userEvent.setup()

await user.keyboard('[ShiftLeft>]') // Press Shift (without releasing it)
await user.click(element) // Perform a click with `shiftKey: true`
```

The instance exposes another `.setup()` API that allows to configure another
instance that shares the same input device state.

The [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard)
is usually not available outside of secure context.  
To enable testing of workflows involving the clipboard,
[`userEvent.setup()`](setup.mdx) replaces `window.navigator.clipboard` with a stub.

## Direct APIs

You can also call the APIs directly on the default export. This will call
`setup` internally and then use the method on the instance.

This exists to ease the transition to version 14 and writing simple tests. Using
the methods on the instances returned by `userEvent.setup()` is recommended.
