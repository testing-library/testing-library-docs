Note that the
[Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard) is
usually not available outside of secure context.  
To enable testing of workflows involving the clipboard,
[`userEvent.setup()`](setup.mdx) replaces `window.navigator.clipboard` with a stub.

## copy()

```ts
copy(): Promise<DataTransfer|undefined>
```

Copy the current selection.

If [`writeToClipboard`](options.mdx#writetoclipboard) is `true`, this will also
write the data to the `Clipboard`.

## cut()

```ts
cut(): Promise<DataTransfer|undefined>
```

Cut the current selection.

If [`writeToClipboard`](options.mdx#writetoclipboard) is `true`, this will also
write the data to the `Clipboard`.

When performed in editable context, it removes the selected content from the
document.

## paste()

```ts
paste(clipboardData?: DataTransfer|string): Promise<void>
```

Paste data into the document.

When called without `clipboardData`, the content to be pasted is read from the
`Clipboard`.

When performed in editable context, the pasted content is inserted into to the
document.
