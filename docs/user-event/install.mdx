```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/user-event
```

Note that `@testing-library/user-event` requires `@testing-library/dom`.

If you use one of the
[framework wrappers](../dom-testing-library/install.mdx#wrappers), it is
important that `@testing-library/dom` is resolved to the same installation
required by the framework wrapper of your choice.  
Usually this means that if you use one of the framework wrappers, you should not
add `@testing-library/dom` to your project dependencies.
