```ts
keyboard(input: KeyboardInput): Promise<void>
```

The `keyboard` API allows to simulate interactions with a keyboard. It accepts a
`string` describing the key actions.

Keystrokes can be described:

- Per printable character
  ```js
  keyboard('foo') // translates to: f, o, o
  ```
  The brackets `{` and `[` are used as special characters and can be referenced
  by doubling them.
  ```js
  keyboard('{{a[[') // translates to: {, a, [
  ```
- Per
  [KeyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)

  ```js
  keyboard('{Shift}{f}{o}{o}') // translates to: Shift, f, o, o
  ```

  This does not keep any key pressed. So `Shift` will be lifted before pressing
  `f`.

  Characters with special meaning inside the key descriptor can be escaped by
  prefixing them with a backslash `\`.

  ```js
  keyboard('{\}}') // translates to: }
  ```

- Per
  [KeyboardEvent.code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code)
  ```js
  keyboard('[ShiftLeft][KeyF][KeyO][KeyO]') // translates to: Shift, f, o, o
  ```

Keys can be kept pressed by adding a `>` to the end of the descriptor.  
If this should result in repeated `keydown` events, you can add the number of
repetitions.  
If the key should also be released after this, add a slash `/` to the end of the
descriptor.

```js
keyboard('{a>}') // press a without releasing it
keyboard('{a>5}') // press a without releasing it and trigger 5 keydown
keyboard('{a>5/}') // press a for 5 keydown and then release it
```

A previously pressed key can be lifted by prefixing the descriptor with `/`.

```js
keyboard('{/a}') // release a previously pressed a
```

This allows to simulate key combinations.

```js
keyboard('{Shift>}A{/Shift}') // translates to: Shift(down), A, Shift(up)
```

The mapping of `key` to `code` is performed by a
[default key map](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/blob/main/src/keyboard/keyMap.ts)
portraying a "default" US-keyboard. You can provide your own local keyboard
mapping per [`keyboardMap`](options.mdx#keyboardmap) option.

Currently the different `key` meanings of single keys are treated as different
keys.

> Future versions might try to interpolate the modifiers needed to reach a
> printable key on the keyboard. E.g. Automatically pressing `{Shift}` when
> CapsLock is not active and `A` is referenced. If you don't wish this behavior,
> you can deactivate the [`autoModify`](options.mdx#automodify) option to opt
> out of this non-breaking change.
