[`user-event`](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event)
is a companion library for Testing Library that simulates user interactions by
dispatching the events that would happen if the interaction took place in a browser.

While most examples with `user-event` are for `React`, the library can be used
with any framework as long as there is a DOM.

## Difference to `fireEvent`

The built-in [`fireEvent`](dom-testing-library/api-events.mdx#fireevent) is a
utility to easier dispatch events.  
It dispatches exactly the event you tell it to and just those - even if that
exact event never had been dispatched in a real interaction in a browser.

`user-event` on the other hand dispatches the events like they would happen if a
user interacted with the document.  
That might lead to the same event you previously dispatched per `fireEvent`
directly, but it also might catch bugs that make it impossible for a user to
trigger said event.  
This is
[why you should use `user-event`](https://ph-fritsche.github.io/blog/post/why-userevent)
to test interaction with your components.

## Writing tests with `userEvent`

We recommend to use [`userEvent.setup()`](setup) when rendering your component
and inline that rendering and setup in your test or use a setup function.  
We discourage rendering or using any `userEvent` functions outside of the test
itself - e.g. in a `before`/`after` hook - for reasons described in
["Avoid Nesting When You're Testing"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing).

```js
test('trigger some awesome feature when clicking the button', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup()
    render(<MyComponent/>)

    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', name: /click me!/))

    // ...assertions...
})
```

```js
function setup(jsx) {
    return {
        user: userEvent.setup(),
        ...render(<MyComponent/>),
    }
}

test('render with a setup function', async () => {
    const { user } = setup(<MyComponent/>)
    // ...
})
```
