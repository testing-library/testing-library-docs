[`user-event`](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) is a companion
library for Testing Library that simulates user interactions by dispatching the
events that would happen if the interaction took place in a browser.

:::note Latest version

These docs describe `user-event@14`. We recommend updating your projects to this
version, as it includes important bug fixes and new features. You can find the
docs for `user-event@13.5.0` [here](../ecosystem-user-event.mdx), and the changelog for the release [here](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/releases/tag/v14.0.0).

:::

While most examples with `user-event` are for `React`, the library can be used
with any framework as long as there is a DOM.

## Differences from `fireEvent`

`fireEvent` dispatches _browser events_, whereas `user-event` simulates full *interactions*, which may fire multiple events and do additional checks along the way.

Testing Library's built-in [`fireEvent`](dom-testing-library/api-events.mdx#fireevent) is a lightweight wrapper around the browser's low-level `dispatchEvent` API, which allows developers to trigger any event on any element. This is often sufficient for testing simple behavior, e.g., checking that a click event triggers the right callback, but there are cases where the browser does more than just trigger one event for one interaction. For example, when a user types into a text box, the element is first focused, and then input events are fired as they type. `user-event` also adds visibility and interactability checks before triggering the flow, to simulate how a user wouldn't click an element they can't see, and the browser wouldn't let them type in a disabled text box.

## Writing tests with `userEvent`

We recommend invoking [`userEvent.setup()`](setup.mdx) before the component is rendered.
This can be done in the test itself, or by using a setup
function. We discourage rendering or using any `userEvent` functions outside of
the test itself - e.g. in a `before`/`after` hook - for reasons described in
["Avoid Nesting When You're Testing"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing).

```js
// inlining
test('trigger some awesome feature when clicking the button', async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup()
  render(<MyComponent />)

  await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', {name: /click me!/i}))

  // ...assertions...
})
```

```js
// setup function
function setup(jsx) {
  return {
    user: userEvent.setup(),
    ...render(jsx),
  }
}

test('render with a setup function', async () => {
  const {user} = setup(<MyComponent />)
  // ...
})
```

Note that, while directly invoking APIs such as `userEvent.click()` (which will trigger `setup` internally) is (still supported in v14)[https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/setup#direct-apis], this option exists to ease the migration from v13 to v14, and for simple tests. We recommend using the methods on the instances returned by `userEvent.setup()`.
