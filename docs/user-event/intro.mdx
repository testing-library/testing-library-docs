[`user-event`](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event)
is a companion library for Testing Library that simulates user interactions by
dispatching the events that would happen if the interaction took place in a browser.

> These docs describe `user-event@14.0.0-beta`.
This is still a pre-release and might be subject to breaking changes
if they should be deemed necessary in the light of feedback we receive for this version.
All planned breaking changes are already implemented though.  
If you are starting or actively working on a project,
we recommend to use this pre-release, as it includes important bug fixes and new features.  
You can find the docs for `user-event@13.5.0` [here](../ecosystem-user-event).

While most examples with `user-event` are for `React`, the library can be used
with any framework as long as there is a DOM.

## Difference to `fireEvent`

The built-in [`fireEvent`](dom-testing-library/api-events.mdx#fireevent) is a
utility to easier dispatch events.  
It dispatches exactly the events you tell it to and just those - even if those
exact events never had been dispatched in a real interaction in a browser.

`user-event` on the other hand dispatches the events like they would happen if a
user interacted with the document.  
That might lead to the same events you previously dispatched per `fireEvent`
directly, but it also might catch bugs that make it impossible for a user to
trigger said events.  
This is
[why you should use `user-event`](https://ph-fritsche.github.io/blog/post/why-userevent)
to test interaction with your components.

## Writing tests with `userEvent`

We recommend to use [`userEvent.setup()`](setup.mdx) when rendering your component
and inline that rendering and setup in your test or use a setup function.  
We discourage rendering or using any `userEvent` functions outside of the test
itself - e.g. in a `before`/`after` hook - for reasons described in
["Avoid Nesting When You're Testing"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing).

```js
test('trigger some awesome feature when clicking the button', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup()
    render(<MyComponent/>)

    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', name: /click me!/))

    // ...assertions...
})
```

```js
function setup(jsx) {
    return {
        user: userEvent.setup(),
        ...render(jsx),
    }
}

test('render with a setup function', async () => {
    const { user } = setup(<MyComponent/>)
    // ...
})
```
