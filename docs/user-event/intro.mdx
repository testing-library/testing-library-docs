[`user-event`](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) is a companion
library for Testing Library that simulates user interactions by dispatching the
events that would happen if the interaction took place in a browser.

> These docs describe `user-event@14`.  
> We recommend updating your projects to this version, as it includes important
> bug fixes and new features. You can find the docs for `user-event@13.5.0`
> [here](../user-event/intro.mdx).

While most examples with `user-event` are for `React`, the library can be used
with any framework as long as there is a DOM.

## Difference to `fireEvent`

The built-in [`fireEvent`](dom-testing-library/api-events.mdx#fireevent) is a
utility to easier dispatch events.  
It dispatches exactly the events you tell it to and just those - even if those
exact events never had been dispatched in a real interaction in a browser.

`user-event` on the other hand dispatches the events like they would happen if a
user interacted with the document.  
That might lead to the same events you previously dispatched per `fireEvent`
directly, but it also might catch bugs that make it impossible for a user to
trigger said events.  
This is
[why you should use `user-event`](https://ph-fritsche.github.io/blog/post/why-userevent)
to test interaction with your components.

## Writing tests with `userEvent`

We recommend to use [`userEvent.setup()`](setup.mdx) when rendering your
component and inline that rendering and setup in your test or use a setup
function.  
We discourage rendering or using any `userEvent` functions outside of the test
itself - e.g. in a `before`/`after` hook - for reasons described in
["Avoid Nesting When You're Testing"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing).

```js
test('trigger some awesome feature when clicking the button', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup()
    render(<MyComponent/>)

    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', name: /click me!/))

    // ...assertions...
})
```

```js
function setup(jsx) {
  return {
    user: userEvent.setup(),
    ...render(jsx),
  }
}

test('render with a setup function', async () => {
  const {user} = setup(<MyComponent />)
  // ...
})
```
