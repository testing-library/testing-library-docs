[`user-event`](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) is a companion
library for Testing Library that simulates user interactions by dispatching the
events that would happen if the interaction took place in a browser.

:::note Latest version

These docs describe `user-event@14`. We recommend updating your projects to this
version, as it includes important bug fixes and new features. You can find the
docs for `user-event@13.5.0` [here](../ecosystem-user-event.mdx), and the
changelog for the release
[here](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/releases/tag/v14.0.0).

:::

While most examples with `user-event` are for `React`, the library can be used
with any framework as long as there is a DOM.

## Differences from `fireEvent`

`fireEvent` dispatches _DOM events_, whereas `user-event` simulates full
_interactions_, which may fire multiple events and do additional checks along
the way.

Testing Library's built-in
[`fireEvent`](dom-testing-library/api-events.mdx#fireevent) is a lightweight
wrapper around the browser's low-level `dispatchEvent` API, which allows
developers to trigger any event on any element. The problem is that the browser
usually does more than just trigger one event for one interaction. For example,
when a user types into a text box, the element has to be focused, and then
keyboard and input events are fired and the selection and value on the element
are manipulated as they type.

`user-event` allows you to describe a user interaction instead of a concrete
event. It adds visibility and interactability checks along the way and
manipulates the DOM just like a user interaction in the browser would. It
factors in that the browser e.g. wouldn't let a user click a hidden element or
type in a disabled text box.  
This is
[why you should use `user-event`](https://ph-fritsche.github.io/blog/post/why-userevent)
to test interaction with your components. 

There are, however, some user interactions or aspects of these [that aren't yet implemented and thus can't yet be described with `user-event`](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aaccuracy%2Cenhancement).
In these cases you can use `fireEvent` to dispatch the concrete events that your software relies on.

Note that this makes your component and/or test reliant upon your assumptions about the concrete aspects of the interaction being correct.
Therefore if you already put in the work to specify the correct aspects of such interaction, please consider contributing to this project so that `user-event` might cover these cases too.

## Writing tests with `userEvent`

We recommend invoking [`userEvent.setup()`](setup.mdx) before the component is
rendered. This can be done in the test itself, or by using a setup function. We
discourage rendering or using any `userEvent` functions outside of the test
itself - e.g. in a `before`/`after` hook - for reasons described in
["Avoid Nesting When You're Testing"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing).

```js
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/vue'

// inlining
test('trigger some awesome feature when clicking the button', async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup()
  render(<MyComponent />)

  await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', {name: /click me!/i}))

  // ...assertions...
})
```

```js
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import { render } from '@testing-library/vue'

// setup function
function setup(jsx) {
  return {
    user: userEvent.setup(),
    ...render(jsx),
  }
}

test('render with a setup function', async () => {
  const {user} = setup(<MyComponent />)
  // ...
})
```

Note that, while directly invoking APIs such as `userEvent.click()` (which will
trigger `setup` internally) is [still supported in
v14](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/setup#direct-apis), this option
exists to ease the migration from v13 to v14, and for simple tests. We recommend
using the methods on the instances returned by `userEvent.setup()`.
