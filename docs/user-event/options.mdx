title: Options

The following options allow to adjust the behavior of `user-event` APIs. They
can be applied per [`setup()`](setup.mdx).

### advanceTimers

If you are using fake timers, you need to advance your timers when we internally
[delay](#delay) subsequent code.

```ts
(delay: number) => Promise<void> | void
```

`default`: `() => Promise.resolve()`

### applyAccept

When using [`upload()`](api-utility.mdx#upload), automatically discard files
that don't match an `accept` property if such property exists on the element.

`default`: `true`

### autoModify

We intend to automatically apply modifier keys for printable characters in the
future.  
I.e. `A` implying `{Shift>}a{/Shift}` if caps lock is not active.

This options allows you to opt out of this change in foresight.  
The feature therefore will not constitute a breaking change.

`default`: `true`

### delay

Between some subsequent inputs like typing a series of characters the code
execution is delayed per `setTimeout` for (at least) `delay` seconds.

This moves the next changes at least to the next macro task and allows other
(asynchronous) code to run between events.

`null` prevents `setTimeout` from being called.

`default`: `0`

### document

The document.

This defaults to the owner document of an element if an API is called
[directly](setup.mdx#direct-api) with an element and without setup. Otherwise it
falls back to the global document.

`default`: `element.ownerDocument ?? globalThis.document`

### keyboardMap

An array of keyboard keys the keyboard device consists of.

This allows to plug in different layouts / localizations.

`default`:
[A "standard" US-104-QWERTY keyboard.](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/blob/main/src/keyboard/keyMap.ts)

### pointerEventsCheck

The pointer API includes a check if an element has or inherits
`pointer-events: none`.  
This check is known to be expensive and very expensive when checking deeply
nested nodes.

This option determines how often the pointer related APIs perform the check.

This is a binary flag option. You can combine multiple Levels.

- `PointerEventsCheckLevel.Never`:  
   No pointer events check
- `PointerEventsCheckLevel.EachTarget`:  
   Check each event target once
- `PointerEventsCheckLevel.EachApiCall`:  
   Check each event target once per API
- `PointerEventsCheckLevel.EachTrigger`:  
   Check pointer events on every user interaction that triggers a bunch of events.
  E.g. once for releasing a mouse button even though this triggers `pointerup`, `mouseup`,
  `click`, etc...

`default`: `PointerEventsCheckLevel.EachApiCall`

### pointerMap

An array of available pointer keys.

This allows to plug in different pointer devices.

`default`:
[A simple mouse and a touchscreen](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/blob/main/src/pointer/keyMap.ts)

### skipAutoClose

[`type()`](api-utility.mdx#type) automatically releases any keys still pressed
at the end of the call.  
This option allows to opt out of this feature.

`default`: false

### skipClick

[`type()`](api-utility.mdx#type) implies a click on the element.  
This option allows to opt out of this feature.

`default`: false

### skipHover

[`click()`](api-convenience.mdx#click) implies moving the cursor to the target
element first.  
This option allows to opt out of this feature.

`default`: false

### writeToClipboard

Write selected data to
[Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard) when
a `cut` or `copy` is triggered. The Clipboard API is usually not available to
test code. Our [`setup()`](setup.mdx) replaces the `navigator.clipboard`
property with a stub.

`default` when calling the APIs [directly](setup.mdx#direct-apis): `false`  
`default` when calling the APIs on an instance from `setup()`: `true`
