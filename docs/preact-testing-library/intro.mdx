[Preact Testing Library on GitHub][gh]

[gh]: https://github.com/testing-library/preact-testing-library

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/preact
```

> This library is built on top of
> [`DOM Testing Library`](dom-testing-library/intro.mdx) which is where most of

## The Problem

You want to write tests for your Preact components so that they avoid including
implementation details, and are maintainable in the long run.

## This Solution

The Preact Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing Preact
components. It provides light utility functions on top of `preact/test-utils`,
in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle
is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

See the [Dom introduction][dom-solution-explainer] and [React
introduction][react-solution-explainer] for a more in-depth explanation.

**What this library is not**:

1.  A test runner or framework.
2.  Specific to a testing framework.

We recommend Jest as our preference. You can checkout
[Using Without Jest](react-testing-library/setup.mdx#using-without-jest) if
you're looking to use another framework.
