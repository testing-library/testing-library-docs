to Angular testing.

<summary>Can I write unit tests with this library?</summary>

Definitely yes! You can write unit and integration tests with this library. See
below for more on how to mock dependencies (because this library intentionally
does NOT support shallow rendering) if you want to unit test a high level
component. The tests in this project show several examples of unit testing with
this library.

As you write your tests, keep in mind:

  If I can't use shallow rendering, how do I mock out components in tests?
</summary>

In general, you should avoid mocking out components (see
[the Guiding Principles section](guiding-principles.mdx)). However, if you need
to, then try to use [ng-mocks](https://ng-mocks.sudo.eu/) and its [`MockBuilder`](https://ng-mocks.sudo.eu/extra/with-3rd-party#testing-libraryangular-and-mockbuilder).

```typescript
import {Component, NgModule} from '@angular/core'
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/angular'
import {MockBuilder} from 'ng-mocks'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent-component',
  template: '<app-child-component></app-child-component>',
})
class ParentComponent {}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child-component',
  template: '<p>Child component</p>',
})
class ChildComponent {}

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ParentComponent, ChildComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}

describe('ParentComponent', () => {
  it('should not render ChildComponent when shallow rendering', async () => {
    // all imports, declarations and exports of AppModule will be mocked.
    const dependencies = MockBuilder(ParentComponent, AppModule).build();

    await render(ParentComponent, dependencies)

    expect(screen.queryByText('Child component')).toBeNull()
  })
})
```

<summary>
  What level of a component tree should I test? Children, parents, or both?
</summary>

Following the guiding principle of this library, it is useful to break down how
tests are organized around how the user experiences and interacts with
application functionality rather than around specific components themselves. In
some cases, for example for reusable component libraries, it might be useful to
include developers in the list of users to test for and test each of the
reusable components individually. Other times, the specific break down of a
component tree is just an implementation detail and testing every component
within that tree individually can cause issues (see
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user).

In practice this means that it is often preferable to test high enough up the
component tree to simulate realistic user interactions. The question of whether
it is worth additionally testing at a higher or lower level on top of this comes
down to a question of tradeoffs and what will provide enough value for the cost
(see https://kentcdodds.com/blog/unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests on more info
on different levels of testing).
