```ts title="counter.component.ts"
@Component({
  selector: 'counter',
  template: `
    <button (click)="decrement()">-</button>
    <span data-testid="count">Current Count: {{ counter }}</span>
    <button (click)="increment()">+</button>
  `,
})
export class CounterComponent {
  @Input() counter = 0

  increment() {
    this.counter += 1
  }

  decrement() {
    this.counter -= 1
  }
}
```

```ts title="counter.component.spec.ts"
import {render, screen, fireEvent} from '@testing-library/angular'
import {CounterComponent} from './counter.component.ts'

describe('Counter', () => {
  test('should render counter', async () => {
    await render(CounterComponent, {
      componentProperties: {counter: 5},
    })

    expect(screen.getByText('Current Count: 5')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  test('should increment the counter on click', async () => {
    await render(CounterComponent, {
      componentProperties: {counter: 5},
    })

    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('+'))

    expect(screen.getByText('Current Count: 6')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

## With Standalone Components

Angular Testing Library can also test your standalone components. In fact, it
even becomes easier because you don't have to set up the whole Angular TestBed.
This was previously only
[possible when you used Single Component Angular Modules (SCAMs)](https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/single-component-angular-modules-and-component-tests-go-hand-in-hand).

Let's migrate the counter component to a standalone component, and let's take a
look at how this affects the test.

```ts title="counter.component.ts"
@Component({
  selector: 'counter',
  template: `
    <button (click)="decrement()">-</button>
    <span data-testid="count">Current Count: {{ counter }}</span>
    <button (click)="increment()">+</button>
  `,
  standalone: true,
})
export class CounterComponent {
  @Input() counter = 0

  increment() {
    this.counter += 1
  }

  decrement() {
    this.counter -= 1
  }
}
```

Just as you would've expected, this doesn't affect the test cases. Writing tests
for standalone components remains the same as for "regular" components.

```ts title="counter.component.spec.ts"
import {render, screen, fireEvent} from '@testing-library/angular'
import {CounterComponent} from './counter.component.ts'

describe('Counter', () => {
  test('should render counter', async () => {
    await render(CounterComponent, {
      componentProperties: {counter: 5},
    })

    expect(screen.getByText('Current Count: 5')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  test('should increment the counter on click', async () => {
    await render(CounterComponent, {
      componentProperties: {counter: 5},
    })

    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('+'))

    expect(screen.getByText('Current Count: 6')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

To override an import of a standalone component for your component test, you can
use the [`componentImports` property](api.mdx#componentImports).
