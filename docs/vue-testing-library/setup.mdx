`Vue Testing Library` does not require any configuration to be used. However,
there are some things you can do when configuring your testing framework to
reduce some boilerplate. In these docs we'll demonstrate configuring Jest, but
you should be able to do similar things with
[any testing framework](#using-without-jest) (Vue Testing Library does not
require that you use Jest).

## Using without Jest

If you're running your tests in the browser bundled with webpack (or similar)
then `Vue Testing Library` should work out of the box for you. However, most
people using Vue Testing Library are using it with the Jest testing framework
with the `testEnvironment` set to `jest-environment-jsdom` (which is the default
configuration with Jest).

`jsdom` is a pure JavaScript implementation of the DOM and browser APIs that
runs in Node. If you're not using Jest and you would like to run your tests in
Node, then you must install jsdom yourself. There's also a package called
`jsdom-global` which can be used to setup the global environment to simulate the
browser APIs.

First, install `jsdom` and `jsdom-global`.

```
npm install --save-dev jsdom jsdom-global
```

With mocha, the test command would look something like this:

```
mocha --require jsdom-global/register
```

### Skipping Auto Cleanup

[`Cleanup`](api.mdx#cleanup) is called after each test automatically by default
if the testing framework you're using supports the `afterEach` global (like
mocha, Jest, and Jasmine). However, you may choose to skip the auto cleanup by
setting the `VTL_SKIP_AUTO_CLEANUP` env variable to 'true'. You can do this with
[`cross-env`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) like so:

```
cross-env VTL_SKIP_AUTO_CLEANUP=true jest
```
