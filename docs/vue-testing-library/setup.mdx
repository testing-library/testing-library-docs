`Vue Testing Library` does not require any configuration to be used.

### Cleanup

#### Jest

[`cleanup`](./api#cleanup) will be called after each test automatically for
Jest, so normally you don't need to change anything.

#### Vitest

If you're using Vitest and want to cleanup after each test, you need to
[enable globals](https://vitest.dev/config/#globals) through its configuration
file.
