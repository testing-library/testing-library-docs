Vue Testing Library builds on top of `DOM Testing Library` by adding APIs for
working with Vue components. It is built on top of
[@vue/test-utils](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils), the official testing
library for Vue.

- [Vue Testing Library on GitHub][gh]

In short, Vue Testing Library does three things:

1. Re-exports query utilities and helpers from `DOM Testing Library`.
2. Hides `@vue/test-utils` methods that are in conflict with Testing Library
   [Guiding Principle](guiding-principles.mdx).
3. Tweaks some methods from both sources.

## Quickstart

If using Vue2

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/vue@5
```

If using Vue3

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/vue
```

You can now use all of `DOM Testing Library`'s `getBy`, `getAllBy`, `queryBy`
and `queryAllBy` commands. See here the
[full list of queries](queries/about.mdx#types-of-queries).

You may also be interested in installing `@testing-library/jest-dom` so you can
use
[the custom Jest matchers](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#readme)
for the DOM.

## The problem

You want to write maintainable tests for your Vue components. As a part of this
goal, **you want your tests to avoid including implementation details** of your
components. You'd rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence for
which they are intended.

## This solution

`Vue Testing Library` is a very light-weight solution for testing Vue
components. It provides light utility functions on top of `@vue/test-utils`, in
a way that encourages better testing practices.

Its primary guiding principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](guiding-principles.mdx)

So rather than dealing with instances of rendered Vue components, **your tests
will work with actual DOM nodes**.

The utilities this library provides facilitate querying the DOM in the same way
the user would. They allow you to find elements by their label text, finding
links and buttons from their text, and assert that your application is
**accessible**.

It also exposes a recommended way to find elements by a `data-testid` as an
"escape hatch" for elements where the text content and label do not make sense
or is not practical.
