`Vue Testing Library` re-exports everything from `DOM Testing Library`.

It also exposes these methods:

- [`render(Component, options)`](#rendercomponent-options)
  - [Parameters](#parameters)
    - [Component](#component)
    - [Options](#options)
  - [`render` result](#render-result)
    - [`...queries`](#queries)
    - [`container`](#container)
    - [`baseElement`](#baseelement)
    - [`debug`](#debugelement)
    - [`unmount`](#unmount)
    - [`html`](#html)
    - [`emitted`](#emitted)
    - [`rerender`](#rerenderprops)
- [`fireEvent`](#fireevent)
  - [`touch(elem)`](#touchelem)
  - [`update(elem, value)`](#updateelem-value)
- [`cleanup`](#cleanup)

## `render(Component, options)`

The `render` function is the only way of rendering components in Vue Testing
Library.

It takes up to 2 parameters and returns an object with some helper methods.

```js
function render(Component, options) {
  return {
    ...DOMTestingLibraryQueries,
    container,
    baseElement,
    debug(element),
    unmount,
    html,
    emitted,
    rerender(props),
  }
}
```

### Parameters

#### Component

The valid Vue Component to be tested.

#### Options

An object containing additional information to be passed to `@vue/test-utils`
[mount](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/options.html#mounting-options).

Additionally, the following options can also be provided:

##### `store` (`Object` | `Store`)

The object definition of a [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) store. If a `store`
object is provided, `Vue Testing Library` will import and configure a Vuex
store. If an instantiated Vuex store is passed, it will be used.

##### `routes` (`Array` | `VueRouter`)

A set of routes for [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/). If `routes` is
provided, the library will import and configure Vue Router. If an instantiated
Vue Router is passed, it will be used.

##### `props` (`Object`)

It will be merged with `propsData`.

##### `container` (`HTMLElement`)

By default, `Vue Testing Library` will create a `div` and append it to the
`baseElement`. This is where your component will be rendered. If you provide
your own `HTMLElement` container via this option, it will not be appended to the
`baseElement` automatically.

For example: If you are unit testing a `tablebody` element, it cannot be a child
of a `div`. In this case, you can specify a `table` as the render `container`.

```js
const table = document.createElement('table')

const {container} = render(TableBody, {
  props,
  container: document.body.appendChild(table),
})
```

##### `baseElement` (`HTMLElement`)

If the `container` is specified, then this defaults to that, otherwise this
defaults to `document.body`. `baseElement` is used as the base element for the
queries as well as what is printed when you use `debug()`.

### `render` result

The `render` method returns an object that has a few properties:

#### `...queries`

The most important feature of `render` is that the queries from
[DOM Testing Library](queries/about.mdx) are automatically returned with their
first argument bound to the [baseElement](#baseelement), which defaults to
`document.body`.

See [Queries](queries/about.mdx) for a complete list.

```js
const {getByLabelText, queryAllByTestId} = render(Component)
```

#### `container`

The containing DOM node of your rendered Vue Component. By default it's a `div`.
This is a regular DOM node, so you can call `container.querySelector` etc. to
inspect the children.

> Tip: To get the root element of your rendered element, use
> `container.firstChild`.

> ðŸš¨ If you find yourself using `container` to query for rendered elements then
> you should reconsider! The other queries are designed to be more resilient to
> changes that will be made to the component you're testing. Avoid using
> `container` to query for elements!

#### `baseElement`

The containing DOM node where your Vue Component is rendered in the `container`.
If you don't specify the `baseElement` in the options of `render`, it will
default to `document.body`.

This is useful when the component you want to test renders something outside the
container `div`, e.g. when you want to snapshot test your portal component which
renders its HTML directly in the body.

> Note: the queries returned by the `render` looks into `baseElement`, so you
> can use queries to test your portal component without the `baseElement`.

#### `debug(element)`

This method is a shortcut for `console.log(prettyDOM(element))`.

```jsx
import {render} from '@testing-library/vue'

const HelloWorldComponent = {
  template: `<h1>Hello World</h1>`,
}

const {debug} = render(HelloWorldComponent)
debug()
// <div>
//   <h1>Hello World</h1>
// </div>
```

This is a simple wrapper around `prettyDOM` which is also exposed and comes from
[`DOM Testing Library`](dom-testing-library/api-debugging.mdx/#prettydom).

#### `unmount()`

An alias for `@vue/test-utils`
[destroy](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/wrapper/#destroy).

#### `html()`

An alias for `@vue/test-utils`
[html](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/wrapper/#html).

#### `emitted()`

An alias for `@vue/test-utils`
[emitted](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/wrapper/#emitted).

#### `rerender(props)`

An alias for `@vue/test-utils`
[setProps](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/api/#setprops).

It returns a Promise through so you can `await rerender(...)`.

## `fireEvent`

Because Vue applies DOM updates asynchronously during re-renders, the
[fireEvent](dom-testing-library/api-events.mdx) tools are re-exported as `async`
functions. To ensure that the DOM is properly updated in response to an event in
a test, it's recommended to always `await` `fireEvent`.

```js
await fireEvent.click(getByText('Click me'))
```

Additionally, Vue Testing Library exposes two useful methods:

### `touch(elem)`

It triggers both `focus()` and `blur()` events.

```js
await fireEvent.touch(getByLabelText('username'))

// Same as:
await fireEvent.focus(getByLabelText('username'))
await fireEvent.blur(getByLabelText('username'))
```

### `update(elem, value)`

Properly handles inputs controlled by `v-model`. It updates the
input/select/textarea inner value while emitting the appropriate native event.

See a working example of `update` in the
[v-model example test](vue-testing-library/examples.mdx#example-using-v-model).

---

## `cleanup`

Unmounts Vue trees that were mounted with
[render](#rendercomponent-options-callback).

> If you are using an environment that supports `afterEach` hook (as in Jest),
> there's no need to call `cleanup` manually. Vue Testing Library handles it for
> you.

Failing to call `cleanup` when you've called `render` could result in a memory
leak and tests which are not idempotent (which can lead to difficult to debug
errors in your tests).
