Sometimes you need to test that an element is present and then disappears or
vice versa.

## Waiting for appearance

If you need to wait for an element to appear, the [async wait
utilities][async-api] allow you to wait for an assertion to be satisfied before
proceeding. The wait utilities retry until the query passes or times out. _The
async methods return a Promise, so you must always use `await` or `.then(done)`
when calling them._

### 1. Using `findBy` Queries

```jsx
test('movie title appears', async () => {
  // element is initially not present...
  // wait for appearance and return the element
  const movie = await findByText('the lion king')
})
```

### 2. Using `waitFor`

```jsx
test('movie title appears', async () => {
  // element is initially not present...

  // wait for appearance inside an assertion
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(getByText('the lion king')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

## Waiting for disappearance

The `waitForElementToBeRemoved` [async helper][async-api] function uses a
callback to query for the element on each DOM mutation and resolves to `true`
when the element is removed.

```jsx
test('movie title no longer present in DOM', async () => {
  // element is removed
  await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => queryByText('the mummy'))
})
```

Using
[`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)
is more efficient than polling the DOM at regular intervals with `waitFor`.

The `waitFor` [async helper][async-api] function retries until the wrapped
function stops throwing an error. This can be used to assert that an element
disappears from the page.

```jsx
test('movie title goes away', async () => {
  // element is initially present...
  // note use of queryBy instead of getBy to return null
  // instead of throwing in the query itself
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(queryByText('i, robot')).not.toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

## Asserting elements are not present

The standard `getBy` methods throw an error when they can't find an element, so
if you want to make an assertion that an element is _not_ present in the DOM,
you can use `queryBy` APIs instead:

```javascript
const submitButton = screen.queryByText('submit')
expect(submitButton).toBeNull() // it doesn't exist
```

The `queryAll` APIs version return an array of matching nodes. The length of the
array can be useful for assertions after elements are added or removed from the
DOM.

```javascript
const submitButtons = screen.queryAllByText('submit')
expect(submitButtons).toHaveLength(0) // expect no elements
```

### `not.toBeInTheDocument`

The [`jest-dom`](ecosystem-jest-dom.mdx) utility library provides the
`.toBeInTheDocument()` matcher, which can be used to assert that an element is
in the body of the document, or not. This can be more meaningful than asserting
a query result is `null`.

```javascript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
// use `queryBy` to avoid throwing an error with `getBy`
const submitButton = screen.queryByText('submit')
expect(submitButton).not.toBeInTheDocument()
```
