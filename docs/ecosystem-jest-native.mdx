[`Jest Native`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-native) is a companion
library for `React Native Testing Library` that provides custom element matchers
for Jest.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-native
```

```jsx
const {queryByTestId} = render(
  <View>
    <View testID="not-empty">
      <Text testID="empty" />
    </View>
    <Text testID="visible">Visible Example</Text>
  </View>,
)

expect(queryByTestId('not-empty')).not.toBeEmpty()
```

> Note: when using some of these matchers, you may need to make sure you use a
> query function (like `queryByTestId`) rather than a get function (like
> `getByTestId`). Otherwise the `get*` function could throw an error before your
> assertion.

> [!CAUTION]
> **This package is deprecated and is no longer actively maintained.**
> 
> We encourage you to migrate to React Native Testing Library, v12.4 or later, which includes modern [built-in Jest matchers](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api/jest-matchers) based on the matchers for this repository.
>
> The migration process should be relatively straightforward, we have a [migration guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/migration/jest-matchers) available.
