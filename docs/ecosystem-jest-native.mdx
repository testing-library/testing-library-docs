:::warning

**This package is deprecated and is no longer actively maintained.**

We encourage you to migrate to React Native Testing Library, v12.4 or later,
which includes modern
[built-in Jest matchers](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api/jest-matchers)
based on the matchers for this repository. The migration process should be
relatively straightforward, we have a
[migration guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/migration/jest-matchers)
available.

:::

[`Jest Native`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-native) is a companion
library for `React Native Testing Library` that provides custom element matchers
for Jest.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-native
```

```jsx
const {queryByTestId} = render(
  <View>
    <View testID="not-empty">
      <Text testID="empty" />
    </View>
    <Text testID="visible">Visible Example</Text>
  </View>,
)

expect(queryByTestId('not-empty')).not.toBeEmpty()
```

> Note: when using some of these matchers, you may need to make sure you use a
> query function (like `queryByTestId`) rather than a get function (like
> `getByTestId`). Otherwise the `get*` function could throw an error before your
> assertion.

Check out
[Jest Native's documentation](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-native)
for a full list of available matchers.
