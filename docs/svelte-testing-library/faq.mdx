## Does this library also work with SvelteKit?

Yes, it does. It requires the same [setup](setup.mdx) as a "normal" Svelte
project.

## Testing file upload component

File upload handler not triggering? Use `happy-dom`, not `jsdom`, and make sure
to use `fireEvent.change(...)` and not `fireEvent.input(...)`. It seems that
jsdom (which is at v22.1.0 at the time of this writing) doesn't fake all the
File object as it should.

See
[svelte-testing-library's issue 219](https://github.com/testing-library/svelte-testing-library/issues/219)
for more details.
