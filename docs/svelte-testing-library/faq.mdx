## Testing file upload component

File upload handler not triggering? Use `happy-dom`, not `jsdom`, and make
sure to use `fireEvent.change(...)` and not `fireEvent.input(...)`.  It seems
that jsdom (which is at v22.1.0 at the time of this writing) doesn't fake all
the File object as it should.


See [svelte-testing-library's issue
219](https://github.com/testing-library/svelte-testing-library/issues/219) for
more details.
