## Does this library also work with SvelteKit?

Yes, it does. It requires the same [setup][] as a "normal" Svelte project.

## Why isn't `onMount` called when rendering components?

Since the test is running in a Node environment instead of a browser
environment, it uses the SSR exports from Svelte, which declare all lifecycle
events as no-ops.

One solution is to configure Vite to use browser resolutions in tests.

```js title="vite.config.js"
import {svelte} from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte'
import {defineConfig} from 'vite'

export default defineConfig(({mode}) => ({
  plugins: [svelte()],
  resolve: {
    // The default would be [ 'svelte', 'node' ]
    // as set by vite-plugin-svelte and vitest.
    // This sets [ 'browser', 'svelte', 'node' ]
    conditions: mode === 'test' ? ['browser'] : [],
  },
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
  },
}))
```

## How do I test file upload?

Use the [upload][] utility from `@testing-library/user-event` rather than
`fireEvent`. It works well in both [jsdom][] and [happy-dom][].

```js
test('upload file', async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup()

  render(Uploader)
  const file = new File(['hello'], 'hello.png', {type: 'image/png'})
  const input = screen.getByLabelText(/upload file/i)

  await user.upload(input, file)

  expect(input.files[0]).toBe(file)
  expect(input.files.item(0)).toBe(file)
  expect(input.files).toHaveLength(1)
})
```

[happy-dom]: https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom

## Why aren't [transition events][] running?

The [jsdom][] implementation of `requestAnimationFrame` can be unreliable in
Vitest. To work around it, you can:

- Switch to [happy-dom][], if you are able, which does not exhibit the same
  issues
- Replace the implementation of `requestAnimationFrame`

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  const raf = fn => setTimeout(() => fn(new Date()), 16)
  vi.stubGlobal('requestAnimationFrame', raf)
})

// Alternatively, set `unstubGlobals: true` in vitest.config.js
afterEach(() => {
  vi.unstubAllGlobals()
})
```
