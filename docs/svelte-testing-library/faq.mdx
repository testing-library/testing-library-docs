## Does this library also work with SvelteKit?

Yes, it does. It requires the same [setup](setup.mdx) as a "normal" Svelte
project.

## `onMount` isn't called when rendering components

Since the test is running in a Node environment instead of a browser
environment, it uses the SSR exports from Svelte, which declare 
all lifecycle events as no-ops.

One solution is to configure Vite to use browser resolutions in tests. 

```js title="vite.config.js"

import { svelte } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  plugins: [svelte()],
  resolve: {
    // the default would be [ 'svelte', 'node' ] 
    // as set by vite-plugin-svelte and vitest
    conditions: mode === 'test' ? ['browser'] : [],
  },
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
  },
};

```

## Testing file upload component

File upload handler not triggering? Use `happy-dom`, not `jsdom`, and make sure
to use `fireEvent.change(...)` and not `fireEvent.input(...)`. It seems that
jsdom (which is at v22.1.0 at the time of this writing) doesn't fake all the
File object as it should.
