## The Problem

You want to write tests for your Svelte components so that they avoid including
implementation details, and are maintainable in the long run.

## This Solution

The Svelte Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing Svelte
components. It provides light utility functions on top of `svelte`, in a way
that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

So rather than dealing with instances of rendered Svelte components, your tests
will work with actual DOM nodes. See the [Dom
Introduction][dom-solution-explainer] for a more in-depth explanation.

**What this library is not**:

1.  A test runner or framework.
2.  Specific to a testing framework.

We recommend Jest as our preference.
