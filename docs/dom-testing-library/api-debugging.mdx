## Automatic Logging

When any `get` or `find` calls you use in your test cases fail, the current
state of the `container` (DOM) gets printed on the console. For example:

```javascript
// <div>Hello world</div>
getByText(container, 'Goodbye world') // will fail by throwing error
```

The above test case will fail, however it prints the state of your DOM under
test, so you will get to see:

```
Unable to find an element with the text: Goodbye world. This could be because the text is broken up by multiple elements. In this case, you can provide a function for your text matcher to make your matcher more flexible.
Here is the state of your container:
<div>
  <div>
    Hello world
  </div>
</div>
```

**Note**: Since the DOM size can get really large, you can set the limit of DOM
content to be printed via environment variable `DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT`. The default
value is `7000`. You will see `...` in the console, when the DOM content is
stripped off, because of the length you have set or due to default size limit.
Here's how you might increase this limit when running tests:

```bash npm2yarn
DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT=10000 npm test
```

This works on macOS/Linux, you'll need to do something else for Windows. If
you'd like a solution that works for both, see
[`cross-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env).

**Note**: The output of the DOM is colorized by default if your tests are
running in a node environment. However, you may sometimes want to turn off
colors, such as in cases where the output is written to a log file for debugging
purposes. You can use the environment variable `COLORS` to explicitly force the
colorization off or on. For example:

```bash npm2yarn
COLORS=false npm test
```

This works on macOS/Linux, you'll need to do something else for Windows. If

## `prettyDOM`

Built on top of
[`pretty-format`](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/pretty-format),
this helper function can be used to print out readable representation of the DOM
tree of a node. This can be helpful for instance when debugging tests.

It is defined as:

```typescript
interface Options extends prettyFormat.OptionsReceived {
  filterNode?: (node: Node) => boolean
}

function prettyDOM(
  node: HTMLElement,
  maxLength?: number,
  options?: Options,
): string
```

It receives the root node to print out, an optional extra parameter to limit the
size of the resulting string, for cases when it becomes too large. It has a last
parameter which allows you to configure your formatting. In addition to the
options listed you can also pass the
[options](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/pretty-format#usage-with-options)
of `pretty-format`.

By default, `<style />`, `<script />` and comment nodes are ignored. You can
configure this behavior by passing a custom `filterNode` function that should
return `true` for every node that you wish to include in the output.

This function is usually used alongside `console.log` to temporarily print out
DOM trees during tests for debugging purposes:

```javascript
import {prettyDOM} from '@testing-library/dom'

const div = document.createElement('div')
div.innerHTML = '<div><h1>Hello World</h1></div>'
console.log(prettyDOM(div))
// <div>
//   <h1>Hello World</h1>
// </div>
```

This function is what also powers
[the automatic debugging output described above](#debugging).

## `screen.debug()`

For convenience `screen` also exposes a `debug` method. This method is
essentially a shortcut for `console.log(prettyDOM())`. It supports debugging the
document, a single element, or an array of elements.

```javascript
import {screen} from '@testing-library/dom'

document.body.innerHTML = `
  <button>test</button>
  <span>multi-test</span>
  <div>multi-test</div>
`

// debug document
screen.debug()
// debug single element
screen.debug(screen.getByText('test'))
// debug multiple elements
screen.debug(screen.getAllByText('multi-test'))
```

## `screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()`

For debugging using [testing-playground](https://testing-playground.com), screen
exposes this convenient method which logs and returns a URL that can be opened
in a browser.

```javascript
import {screen} from '@testing-library/dom'

document.body.innerHTML = `
  <button>test</button>
  <span>multi-test</span>
  <div>multi-test</div>
`

// log entire document to testing-playground
screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()
// log a single element
screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL(screen.getByText('test'))
```

## `logRoles`

This helper function can be used to print out a list of all the implicit ARIA
roles within a tree of DOM nodes, each role containing a list of all of the
nodes which match that role. This can be helpful for finding ways to query the
DOM under test with [getByRole](queries/byrole.mdx).

```javascript
import {logRoles} from '@testing-library/dom'

const nav = document.createElement('nav')
nav.innerHTML = `
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>`

logRoles(nav)
```

Result:

```
navigation:
<nav />
--------------------------------------------------
list:
<ul />
--------------------------------------------------
listitem:
<li />
<li />
--------------------------------------------------
```
