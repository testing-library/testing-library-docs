## `fireEvent`

```typescript
fireEvent(node: HTMLElement, event: Event)
```

Fire DOM events.

```javascript
// <button>Submit</button>
fireEvent(
  getByText(container, 'Submit'),
  new MouseEvent('click', {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
  }),
)
```

## `fireEvent[eventName]`

```typescript
fireEvent[eventName](node: HTMLElement, eventProperties: Object)
```

Convenience methods for firing DOM events. Check out
[src/event-map.js](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/blob/master/src/event-map.js)
for a full list as well as default `eventProperties`.

**target**: When an event is dispatched on an element, the event has the
subjected element on a property called `target`. As a convenience, if you
provide a `target` property in the `eventProperties` (second argument), then
those properties will be assigned to the node which is receiving the event.

This is particularly useful for a change event:

```javascript
fireEvent.change(getByLabelText(/username/i), {target: {value: 'a'}})

// note: attempting to manually set the files property of an HTMLInputElement
// results in an error as the files property is read-only.
// this feature works around that by using Object.defineProperty.
fireEvent.change(getByLabelText(/picture/i), {
  target: {
    files: [new File(['(⌐□_□)'], 'chucknorris.png', {type: 'image/png'})],
  },
})

// Note: The 'value' attribute must use ISO 8601 format when firing a
// change event on an input of type "date". Otherwise the element will not
// reflect the changed value.

// Invalid:
fireEvent.change(input, {target: {value: '24/05/2020'}})

// Valid:
fireEvent.change(input, {target: {value: '2020-05-24'}})
```

**dataTransfer**: Drag events have a `dataTransfer` property that contains data
transferred during the operation. As a convenience, if you provide a
`dataTransfer` property in the `eventProperties` (second argument), then those
properties will be added to the event.

This should predominantly be used for testing drag and drop interactions.

```javascript
fireEvent.drop(getByLabelText(/drop files here/i), {
  dataTransfer: {
    files: [new File(['(⌐□_□)'], 'chucknorris.png', {type: 'image/png'})],
  },
})
```

**Keyboard events**: There are three event types related to keyboard input -
`keyPress`, `keyDown`, and `keyUp`. When firing these you need to reference an
element in the DOM and the key you want to fire.

```javascript
fireEvent.keyDown(domNode, {key: 'Enter', code: 'Enter'})

fireEvent.keyDown(domNode, {key: 'A', code: 'KeyA'})
```

You can find out which key code to use at
[https://keycode.info/](https://keycode.info/).

## `createEvent[eventName]`

```typescript
createEvent[eventName](node: HTMLElement, eventProperties: Object)
```

Convenience methods for creating DOM events that can then be fired by
`fireEvent`, allowing you to have a reference to the event created: this might
be useful if you need to access event properties that cannot be initiated
programmatically (such as `timeStamp`).

```javascript
const myEvent = createEvent.click(node, {button: 2})
fireEvent(node, myEvent)
// myEvent.timeStamp can be accessed just like any other properties from myEvent
// note: The access to the events created by `createEvent` is based on the native event API,
// Therefore, native properties of HTMLEvent object (e.g. `timeStamp`, `cancelable`, `type`) should be set using Object.defineProperty
// For more info see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
```

You can also create generic events:

```javascript
// simulate the 'input' event on a file input
fireEvent(
  input,
  createEvent('input', input, {
    target: {files: inputFiles},
    ...init,
  }),
)
```

## Using Jest Function Mocks

[Jest's Mock functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions) can be used to
test that a callback passed to the function was called, or what it was called
when the event that **should** trigger the callback function does trigger the
bound callback.

  <Tabs
    defaultValue="react"
    values={[
      { label: 'React', value: 'react', }
    ]
  }>
  <TabItem value="react">

```jsx
import {render, screen, fireEvent} from '@testing-library/react'

const Button = ({onClick, children}) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
)

test('calls onClick prop when clicked', () => {
  const handleClick = jest.fn()
  render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>)
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/click me/i))
  expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
