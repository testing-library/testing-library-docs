title: Async Methods
---

Several utilities are provided for dealing with asynchronous code. These can be
useful to wait for an element to appear or disappear in response to an event,
user action, timeout, or Promise. (See the
[guide to testing disappearance](guide-disappearance.mdx).)

The async methods return Promises, so be sure to use `await` or `.then` when
calling them.

## `findBy` Queries

`findBy` methods are a combination of `getBy`
[queries](queries/about.mdx#types-of-queries) and [`waitFor`](#waitfor). They
accept the waitFor options as the last argument (e.g.
`await screen.findByText('text', queryOptions, waitForOptions)`).

`findBy` queries work when you expect an element to appear but the change to the
DOM might not happen immediately.

```js
const button = screen.getByRole('button', {name: 'Click Me'})
fireEvent.click(button)
await screen.findByText('Clicked once')
fireEvent.click(button)
await screen.findByText('Clicked twice')
```

## `waitFor`

```typescript
function waitFor<T>(
  callback: () => T | Promise<T>,
  options?: {
    container?: HTMLElement
    timeout?: number
    interval?: number
    onTimeout?: (error: Error) => Error
    mutationObserverOptions?: MutationObserverInit
  },
): Promise<T>
```

When in need to wait for any period of time you can use `waitFor`, to wait for
your expectations to pass. Returning _a falsy condition is not sufficient_ to
trigger a retry, the callback must throw an error in order to retry the
condition. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
// ...
// Wait until the callback does not throw an error. In this case, that means
// it'll wait until the mock function has been called once.
await waitFor(() => expect(mockAPI).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1))
// ...
```

`waitFor` may run the callback a number of times until the timeout is reached.
Note that the number of calls is constrained by the `timeout` and `interval`
options.

This can be useful if you have a unit test that mocks API calls and you need to
wait for your mock promises to all resolve.

If you return a promise in the `waitFor` callback (either explicitly or
implicitly with the `async` syntax), then the `waitFor` utility does not call
your callback again until that promise rejects. This allows you to `waitFor`
things that must be checked asynchronously.

The default `container` is the global `document`. Make sure the elements you
wait for are descendants of `container`.

The default `interval` is `50ms`. However it runs your callback immediately
before starting the intervals.

The default `timeout` is `1000ms`.

The default `onTimeout` takes the error and appends the `container`'s printed
state to the error message which should hopefully make it easier to track down
what caused the timeout.

The default `mutationObserverOptions` is
`{subtree: true, childList: true, attributes: true, characterData: true}` which
detects additions and removals of child elements (including text nodes) in the
`container` and any of its descendants. It also detects attribute changes. When
any of those changes occur, it re-runs the callback.

## `waitForElementToBeRemoved`

```typescript
function waitForElementToBeRemoved<T>(
  callback: (() => T) | T,
  options?: {
    container?: HTMLElement
    timeout?: number
    interval?: number
    onTimeout?: (error: Error) => Error
    mutationObserverOptions?: MutationObserverInit
  },
): Promise<void>
```

To wait for the removal of element(s) from the DOM you can use
`waitForElementToBeRemoved`. The `waitForElementToBeRemoved` function is a small
wrapper around the `waitFor` utility.

The first argument must be an element, array of elements, or a callback which
returns an element or array of elements.

Here is an example where the promise resolves because the element is removed:

```javascript
const el = document.querySelector('div.getOuttaHere')

waitForElementToBeRemoved(document.querySelector('div.getOuttaHere')).then(() =>
  console.log('Element no longer in DOM'),
)

el.setAttribute('data-neat', true)
// other mutations are ignored...

el.parentElement.removeChild(el)
// logs 'Element no longer in DOM'
```

`waitForElementToBeRemoved` throws an error if the first argument is `null` or
an empty array:

```javascript
waitForElementToBeRemoved(null).catch(err => console.log(err))
waitForElementToBeRemoved(queryByText(/not here/i)).catch(err =>
  console.log(err),
)
waitForElementToBeRemoved(queryAllByText(/not here/i)).catch(err =>
  console.log(err),
)
waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => getByText(/not here/i)).catch(err =>
  console.log(err),
)

// Error: The element(s) given to waitForElementToBeRemoved are already removed. waitForElementToBeRemoved requires that the element(s) exist(s) before waiting for removal.
```

The options object is forwarded to `waitFor`.
