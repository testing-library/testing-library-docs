## Overview

Queries are the methods that Testing Library gives you to find elements on the
page. There are several [types of queries](#types-of-queries) ("get", "find",
"query"); the difference between them is whether the query will throw an error
if no element is found or if it will return a Promise and retry. Depending on
what page content you are selecting, different queries may be more or less
appropriate. See the [priority guide](#priority) for recommendations on how to
make use of semantic queries to test your page in the most accessible way.

After selecting an element, you can use the
[Events API](dom-testing-library/api-events.mdx) or
[user-event](ecosystem-user-event.mdx) to fire events and simulate user
interactions with the page, or use Jest and [jest-dom](ecosystem-jest-dom.mdx)
to make assertions about the element.

There are Testing Library helper methods that work with queries. As elements
appear and disappear in response to actions,
[Async APIs](dom-testing-library/api-async.mdx) like
[`waitFor`](dom-testing-library/api-async.mdx#waitfor) or
[`findBy` queries](dom-testing-library/api-async.mdx#findby-queries) can be used
to await the changes in the DOM. To find only elements that are children of a
specific element, you can use [`within`](dom-testing-library/api-within.mdx). If
necessary, there are also a few options you can
[configure](dom-testing-library/api-configuration.mdx), like the timeout for
retries and the default testID attribute.

## Example

```jsx
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react' // (or /dom, /vue, ...)

test('should show login form', () => {
  render(<Login />)
  const input = screen.getByLabelText('Username')
  // Events and assertions...
})
```

## Types of Queries

- Single Elements
  - `getBy...`: Returns the matching node for a query, and throw a descriptive
    error if no elements match _or_ if more than one match is found (use
    `getAllBy` instead if more than one element is expected).
  - `queryBy...`: Returns the matching node for a query, and return `null` if no
    elements match. This is useful for asserting an element that is not present.
    Throws an error if more than one match is found (use `queryAllBy` instead if
    this is OK).
  - `findBy...`: Returns a Promise which resolves when an element is found which
    matches the given query. The promise is rejected if no element is found or
    if more than one element is found after a default timeout of 1000ms. If you
    need to find more than one element, use `findAllBy`.
- Multiple Elements
  - `getAllBy...`: Returns an array of all matching nodes for a query, and
    throws an error if no elements match.
  - `queryAllBy...`: Returns an array of all matching nodes for a query, and
    return an empty array (`[]`) if no elements match.
  - `findAllBy...`: Returns a promise which resolves to an array of elements
    when any elements are found which match the given query. The promise is
    rejected if no elements are found after a default timeout of `1000`ms.
    - `findBy` methods are a combination of `getBy*` queries and
      [`waitFor`](../dom-testing-library/api-async.mdx#waitfor). They accept the
      `waitFor` options as the last argument (i.e.
      `await screen.findByText('text', queryOptions, waitForOptions)`)

## Priority

Based on [the Guiding Principles](guiding-principles.mdx), your test should
resemble how users interact with your code (component, page, etc.) as much as
possible. With this in mind, we recommend this order of priority:

1. **Queries Accessible to Everyone** Queries that reflect the experience of
   visual/mouse users as well as those that use assistive technology.
   1. `getByRole`: This can be used to query every element that is exposed in
      the
      [accessibility tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AOM).
      With the `name` option you can filter the returned elements by their
      [accessible name](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/). This should be your
      top preference for just about everything. There's not much you can't get
      with this (if you can't, it's possible your UI is inaccessible). Most
      often, this will be used with the `name` option like so:
      `getByRole('button', {name: /submit/i})`. Check the
      [list of roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#Roles).
   1. `getByLabelText`: This method is really good for form fields. When
      navigating through a website form, users find elements using label text.
      This method emulates that behavior, so it should be your top preference.
   1. `getByPlaceholderText`:
      [A placeholder is not a substitute for a label](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/).
      But if that's all you have, then it's better than alternatives.
   1. `getByText`: Outside of forms, text content is the main way users find
      elements. This method can be used to find non-interactive elements (like
      divs, spans, and paragraphs).
   1. `getByDisplayValue`: The current value of a form element can be useful
      when navigating a page with filled-in values.
1. **Semantic Queries** HTML5 and ARIA compliant selectors. Note that the user
   experience of interacting with these attributes varies greatly across
   browsers and assistive technology.
   1. `getByAltText`: If your element is one which supports `alt` text (`img`,
      `area`, `input`, and any custom element), then you can use this to find that element.
   1. `getByTitle`: The title attribute is not consistently read by
      screenreaders, and is not visible by default for sighted users
1. **Test IDs**
   1. `getByTestId`: The user cannot see (or hear) these, so this is only
      recommended for cases where you can't match by role or text or it doesn't
      make sense (e.g. the text is dynamic).

## Using Queries

The base queries from DOM Testing Library require you to pass a `container` as
the first argument. Most framework-implementations of Testing Library provide a
pre-bound version of these queries when you render your components with them
which means you _do not have to provide a container_. In addition, if you just
want to query `document.body` then you can use the [`screen`](#screen) export as
demonstrated below (using `screen` is recommended).

The primary argument to a query can be a _string_, _regular expression_, or
_function_. There are also options to adjust how node text is parsed. See
[TextMatch](#textmatch) for documentation on what can be passed to a query.

Given the following DOM elements (which can be rendered by React, Vue, Angular,
or plain HTML code):

```js
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <label for="username-input">Username</label>
    <input id="username-input" />
  </div>
</body>
```

You can use a query to find an element (byLabelText, in this case):

```js
import {screen, getByLabelText} from '@testing-library/dom'

// With screen:
const inputNode1 = screen.getByLabelText('Username')

// Without screen, you need to provide a container:
const container = document.querySelector('#app')
const inputNode2 = getByLabelText(container, 'Username')
```

### `screen`

All of the queries exported by DOM Testing Library accept a `container` as the
first argument. Because querying the entire `document.body` is very common, DOM
Testing Library also exports a `screen` object which has every query that is
pre-bound to `document.body` (using the
[`within`](dom-testing-library/api-within.mdx) functionality). Wrappers such as
React Testing Library re-export `screen` so you can use it the same way.

Here's how you use it:

<Tabs defaultValue="native" values={[ { label: 'Native', value: 'native', }, {
label: 'React', value: 'react', }, { label: 'Cypress', value: 'cypress', }, ] }>
<TabItem value="native">

```js
import {screen} from '@testing-library/dom'

document.body.innerHTML = `
  <label for="example">Example</label>
  <input id="example" />
`

const exampleInput = screen.getByLabelText('Example')
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react">

```jsx
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'

render(
  <div>
    <label htmlFor="example">Example</label>
    <input id="example" />
  </div>,
)

const exampleInput = screen.getByLabelText('Example')
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cypress">

```js
cy.findByLabelText('Example').should('exist')
```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

> **Note**
>
> You need a global DOM environment to use `screen`. If you're using jest, with
> the
> [testEnvironment](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#testenvironment-string)
> set to `jsdom`, a global DOM environment will be available for you.
>
> If you're loading your test with a `script` tag, make sure it comes after the
> `body`. An example can be seen
> [here](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/issues/700#issuecomment-692218886).

## `TextMatch`

Most of the query APIs take a `TextMatch` as an argument, which means the
argument can be either a _string_, _regex_, or a _function_ which returns `true`
for a match and `false` for a mismatch.

### TextMatch Examples

Given the following HTML:

```html
<div>Hello World</div>
```

**_Will_ find the div:**

```javascript
// Matching a string:
screen.getByText('Hello World') // full string match
screen.getByText('llo Worl', {exact: false}) // substring match
screen.getByText('hello world', {exact: false}) // ignore case

// Matching a regex:
screen.getByText(/World/) // substring match
screen.getByText(/world/i) // substring match, ignore case
screen.getByText(/^hello world$/i) // full string match, ignore case
screen.getByText(/Hello W?oRlD/i) // substring match, ignore case, searches for "hello world" or "hello orld"

// Matching with a custom function:
screen.getByText((content, element) => content.startsWith('Hello'))
```

**_Will not_ find the div:**

```javascript
// full string does not match
screen.getByText('Goodbye World')

// case-sensitive regex with different case
screen.getByText(/hello world/)

// function looking for a span when it's actually a div:
screen.getByText((content, element) => {
  return element.tagName.toLowerCase() === 'span' && content.startsWith('Hello')
})
```

### Precision

Queries that take a `TextMatch` also accept an object as the final argument that
can contain options that affect the precision of string matching:

- `exact`: Defaults to `true`; matches full strings, case-sensitive. When false,
  matches substrings and is not case-sensitive.
  - `exact` has no effect on `regex` or `function` arguments.
  - In most cases using a regex instead of a string gives you more control over
    fuzzy matching and should be preferred over `{ exact: false }`.
- `normalizer`: An optional function which overrides normalization behavior. See
  [`Normalization`](#normalization).

### Normalization

Before running any matching logic against text in the DOM, `DOM Testing Library`
automatically normalizes that text. By default, normalization consists of
trimming whitespace from the start and end of text, and collapsing multiple
adjacent whitespace characters into a single space.

If you want to prevent that normalization, or provide alternative normalization
(e.g. to remove Unicode control characters), you can provide a `normalizer`
function in the options object. This function will be given a string and is
expected to return a normalized version of that string.

> **Note**
>
> Specifying a value for `normalizer` _replaces_ the built-in normalization, but
> you can call `getDefaultNormalizer` to obtain a built-in normalizer, either to
> adjust that normalization or to call it from your own normalizer.

`getDefaultNormalizer` takes an options object which allows the selection of
behaviour:

- `trim`: Defaults to `true`. Trims leading and trailing whitespace
- `collapseWhitespace`: Defaults to `true`. Collapses inner whitespace
  (newlines, tabs, repeated spaces) into a single space.

#### Normalization Examples

To perform a match against text without trimming:

```javascript
screen.getByText('text', {
  normalizer: getDefaultNormalizer({trim: false}),
})
```

To override normalization to remove some Unicode characters whilst keeping some
(but not all) of the built-in normalization behavior:

```javascript
screen.getByText('text', {
  normalizer: str =>
    getDefaultNormalizer({trim: false})(str).replace(/[\u200E-\u200F]*/g, ''),
})
```

## Debugging

### `screen.debug()`

For convenience screen also exposes a `debug` method in addition to the queries.
This method is essentially a shortcut for `console.log(prettyDOM())`. It
supports debugging the document, a single element, or an array of elements.

```javascript
import {screen} from '@testing-library/dom'

document.body.innerHTML = `
  <button>test</button>
  <span>multi-test</span>
  <div>multi-test</div>
`

// debug document
screen.debug()
// debug single element
screen.debug(screen.getByText('test'))
// debug multiple elements
screen.debug(screen.getAllByText('multi-test'))
```

### `screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()`

For debugging using [testing-playground](https://testing-playground.com), screen
exposes this convenient method which logs a URL that can be opened in a browser.

```javascript
import {screen} from '@testing-library/dom'

document.body.innerHTML = `
  <button>test</button>
  <span>multi-test</span>
  <div>multi-test</div>
`

// log entire document to testing-playground
screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()
// log a single element
screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL(screen.getByText('test'))
```

## Manual Queries

On top of the queries provided by the testing library, you can use the regular
[`querySelector` DOM API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)
to query elements. Note that using this as an escape hatch to query by class or
id is not recommended because they are invisible to the user. Use a testid if
you have to, to make your intention to fall back to non-semantic queries clear
and establish a stable API contract in the HTML.

```jsx
// @testing-library/react
const {container} = render(<MyComponent />)
const foo = container.querySelector('[data-foo="bar"]')
```

## Browser extension

Do you still have problems knowing how to use Testing Library queries?

There is a very cool Browser extension for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano/related)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/testing-playground/)
named Testing Playground, and it helps you find the best queries to select
elements. It allows you to inspect the element hierarchies in the Browser's
Developer Tools, and provides you with suggestions on how to select them, while
encouraging good testing practices.

## Playground

If you want to get more familiar with these queries, you can try them out on
[testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com). Testing Playground is
an interactive sandbox where you can run different queries against your own
html, and get visual feedback matching the rules mentioned above.
