## API

```typescript
getByRole(
  // If you're using `screen`, then skip the container argument:
  container: HTMLElement,
  role: string,
  options?: {
    hidden?: boolean = false,
    name?: TextMatch,
    description?: TextMatch,
    selected?: boolean,
    checked?: boolean,
    pressed?: boolean,
    suggest?: boolean,
    current?: boolean | string,
    expanded?: boolean,
    queryFallbacks?: boolean,
    level?: number,
  }): HTMLElement
```

Queries for elements with the given role (and it also accepts a
[`TextMatch`](queries/about.mdx#textmatch)). Default roles are taken into
consideration e.g. `<button />` has the `button` role without explicitly setting
the `role` attribute. Here you can see
[a table of HTML elements with their default and desired roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance).

Please note that setting a `role` and/or `aria-*` attribute that matches the
implicit ARIA semantics is unnecessary and is **not recommended** as these
properties are already set by the browser, and we must not use the `role` and
`aria-*` attributes in a manner that conflicts with the semantics described. For
example, a `button` element can't have the `role` attribute of `heading`,
because the `button` element has default characteristics that conflict with the
`heading` role.

> Roles are matched literally by string equality, without inheriting from the
> ARIA role hierarchy. As a result, querying a superclass role like `checkbox`
> will not include elements with a subclass role like `switch`.

You can query the returned element(s) by their
[accessible name or description](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/). The
accessible name is for simple cases equal to e.g. the label of a form element,
or the text content of a button, or the value of the `aria-label` attribute. It
can be used to query a specific element if multiple elements with the same role
are present on the rendered content. For an in-depth guide check out
["What is an accessible name?" from TPGi](https://www.tpgi.com/what-is-an-accessible-name/).
If you only query for a single element with `getByText('The name')` it's
oftentimes better to use `getByRole(expectedRole, { name: 'The name' })`. The
accessible name query does not replace other queries such as `*ByAlt` or
`*ByTitle`. While the accessible name can be equal to these attributes, it does
not replace the functionality of these attributes. For example
`<img aria-label="fancy image" src="fancy.jpg" />` will be returned for
`getByRole('img', { name: 'fancy image' })`. However, the image will not display
its description if `fancy.jpg` could not be loaded. Whether you want to assert
this functionality in your test or not is up to you.

## Options

### `hidden`

If you set `hidden` to `true` elements that are normally excluded from the
accessibility tree are considered for the query as well. The default behavior
follows https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#tree_exclusion with the exception of
`role="none"` and `role="presentation"` which are considered in the query in any
case. For example in

```html
<body>
  <main aria-hidden="true">
    <button>Open dialog</button>
  </main>
  <div role="dialog">
    <button>Close dialog</button>
  </div>
</body>
```

`getByRole('button')` would only return the `Close dialog`-button. To make
assertions about the `Open dialog`-button you would need to use
`getAllByRole('button', { hidden: true })`.

The default value for `hidden` can
[be configured](../dom-testing-library/api-configuration.mdx#configuration).

### `selected`

You can filter the returned elements by their selected state by setting
`selected: true` or `selected: false`.

For example in

```html
<body>
  <div role="tablist">
    <button role="tab" aria-selected="true">Native</button>
    <button role="tab" aria-selected="false">React</button>
    <button role="tab" aria-selected="false">Cypress</button>
  </div>
</body>
```

you can get the "Native"-tab by calling `getByRole('tab', { selected: true })`.
To learn more about the selected state and which elements can have this state
see [ARIA `aria-selected`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-selected).

### `checked`

You can filter the returned elements by their checked state by setting
`checked: true` or `checked: false`.

For example in

```html
<body>
  <section>
    <button role="checkbox" aria-checked="true">Sugar</button>
    <button role="checkbox" aria-checked="false">Gummy bears</button>
    <button role="checkbox" aria-checked="false">Whipped cream</button>
  </section>
</body>
```

you can get the "Sugar" option by calling
`getByRole('checkbox', { checked: true })`. To learn more about the checked
state and which elements can have this state see
[ARIA `aria-checked`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-checked).

> **Note**
>
> Checkboxes have a "mixed" state, which is considered neither checked nor
> unchecked (details [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#details-id-56)).

### `current`

You can filter the returned elements by their current state by setting
`current: boolean | string`. Note that no `aria-current` attribute will match
`current: false` since `false` is the default value for `aria-current`.

For example in

```html
<body>
  <nav>
    <a href="current/page" aria-current="true">üëç</a>
    <a href="another/page">üëé</a>
  </nav>
</body>
```

you can get the "üëç" link by calling `getByRole('link', { current: true })` and
the "üëé" by calling `getByRole('link', { current: false })`. To learn more about
the current state see
[ARIA `aria-current`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-current).

### `pressed`

Buttons can have a pressed state. You can filter the returned elements by their
pressed state by setting `pressed: true` or `pressed: false`.

For example in

```html
<body>
  <section>
    <button aria-pressed="true">üëç</button>
    <button aria-pressed="false">üëé</button>
  </section>
</body>
```

you can get the "üëç" button by calling `getByRole('button', { pressed: true })`.
To learn more about the pressed state see
[ARIA `aria-pressed`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-pressed).

### `suggest`

You can disable the ability to
[throw suggestions](../dom-testing-library/api-configuration.mdx#throwsuggestions-experimental)
for a specific query by setting this value to `false`.  
Setting this value to `true` will throw suggestions for the specific query.

### `expanded`

You can filter the returned elements by their expanded state by setting
`expanded: true` or `expanded: false`.

For example in

```html
<body>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" href="..."
          >Expandable Menu Item</a
        >
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Submenu Item 1</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Submenu Item 1</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#">Regular Menu Item</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</body>
```

you can get the "Expandable Menu Item" link by calling
`getByRole('link', { expanded: false })`. To learn more about the expanded state
and which elements can have this state see
[ARIA `aria-expanded`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-expanded).

```html
<div role="dialog">...</div>
```

<Tabs defaultValue="native" values={[ { label: 'Native', value: 'native', }, {
label: 'React', value: 'react', }, { label: 'Cypress', value: 'cypress', }, ] }>
<TabItem value="native">

```js
import {screen} from '@testing-library/dom'

const dialogContainer = screen.getByRole('dialog')
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react">

```jsx
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'

render(<MyComponent />)
const dialogContainer = screen.getByRole('dialog')
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cypress">

```js
cy.findByRole('dialog').should('exist')
```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

### `queryFallbacks`

By default, it's assumed that the first role of each element is supported, so
only the first role can be queried. If you need to query an element by any of
its fallback roles instead, you can use `queryFallbacks: true`.

For example, `getByRole('switch')` would always match
`<div role="switch checkbox" />` because it's the first role, while
`getByRole('checkbox')` would not. However,
`getByRole('checkbox', { queryFallbacks: true })` would enable all fallback
roles and therefore match the same element.

> An element doesn't have multiple roles in a given environment. It has a single
> one. Multiple roles in the attribute are evaluated from left to right until
> the environment finds the first role it understands. This is useful when new
> roles get introduced and you want to start supporting those as well as older
> environments that don't understand that role (yet).

### `level`

An element with the `heading` role can be queried by any heading level
`getByRole('heading')` or by a specific heading level using the `level` option
`getByRole('heading', { level: 2 })`.

The `level` option queries the element(s) with the `heading` role matching the
indicated level determined by the semantic HTML heading elements `<h1>-<h6>` or
matching the `aria-level` attribute.

Given the example below,

```html
<body>
  <section>
    <h1>Heading Level One</h1>
    <h2>First Heading Level Two</h2>
    <h3>Heading Level Three</h3>
    <div role="heading" aria-level="2">Second Heading Level Two</div>
  </section>
</body>
```

you can query the `Heading Level Three` heading using
`getByRole('heading', { level: 3 })`.

```js
getByRole('heading', {level: 1})
// <h1>Heading Level One</h1>

getAllByRole('heading', {level: 2})
// [
//   <h2>First Heading Level Two</h2>,
//   <div role="heading" aria-level="2">Second Heading Level Two</div>
// ]
```

While it is possible to explicitly set `role="heading"` and `aria-level`
attribute on an element, it is **strongly encouraged** to use the semantic HTML
headings `<h1>-<h6>`.

To learn more about the `aria-level` property, see
[ARIA `aria-level`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-level).

> The `level` option is _only_ applicable to the `heading` role. An error will
> be thrown when used with any other role.

### `description`

You can filter the returned elements by their
[accessible description](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#mapping_additional_nd_description)
for those cases where you have several elements with the same role and they
don't have an accessible name but they do have a description.<br /> This would
be the case for elements with
[alertdialog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#alertdialog) role, where the
`aria-describedby` attribute is used to describe the element's content.

For example in

```html
<body>
  <ul>
    <li role="alertdialog" aria-describedby="notification-id-1">
      <div><button>Close</button></div>
      <div id="notification-id-1">You have unread emails</div>
    </li>
    <li role="alertdialog" aria-describedby="notification-id-2">
      <div><button>Close</button></div>
      <div id="notification-id-2">Your session is about to expire</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</body>
```

You can query a specific element like this

```js
getByRole('alertdialog', {description: 'Your session is about to expire'})
```
