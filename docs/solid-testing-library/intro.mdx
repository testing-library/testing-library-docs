[Solid Testing Library on GitHub][gh]

> Inspired completely by [preact-testing-library][preact-docs]

[preact-docs]: ../preact-testing-library/intro.mdx
[gh]: https://github.com/solidjs/solid-testing-library

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @solidjs/testing-library
```

> This library is built on top of
> [`DOM Testing Library`](dom-testing-library/intro.mdx) which is where most of
> the logic behind the queries is.

## The Problem

You want to write tests for your Solid components so that they avoid including
implementation details, and are maintainable in the long run.

## This Solution

The Solid Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing Solid
components. Its primary guiding principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

See the [Dom introduction][dom-solution-explainer] and [React
introduction][react-solution-explainer] for a more in-depth explanation.

[react-solution-explainer]: ../react-testing-library/intro.mdx#this-solution

**What this library is not**:

1.  A test runner or framework.
2.  Specific to a testing framework.

If you using Jest we recommend using
[solid-jest](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-jest) to properly resolve the
browser version of Solid as Jest will default to the server version when run in
Node.

ðŸ’¡ If you are using Jest or vitest, you may also be interested in installing
`@testing-library/jest-dom` so you can use [the custom jest matchers][jest-dom].
