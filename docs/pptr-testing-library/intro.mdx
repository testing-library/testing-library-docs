title: Puppeteer Testing Library
---

[`pptr-testing-library`][gh] is a lightweight adapter allowing
`DOM Testing Library` to be used with [`puppeteer`][ghpuppeteer].

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev puppeteer pptr-testing-library
```

- [pptr-testing-library on GitHub][gh]

## Usage

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')
const {getDocument, queries, waitFor} = require('pptr-testing-library')

const {getByTestId, getByLabelText} = queries

const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()

// Grab ElementHandle for document
const $document = await getDocument(page)
// Your favorite query methods are available
const $form = await getByTestId($document, 'my-form')
// returned elements are Puppeteer ElementHandles too!
const $email = await getByLabelText($form, 'Email')
// interact with puppeteer like usual
await $email.type('pptr@example.com')
// waiting works too!
await waitFor(() => getByText('Loading...'))
```

A little too un-puppeteer for you? You can attach all the `DOM Testing Library`
methods directly onto puppeteer's `ElementHandle` instead!

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')
require('pptr-testing-library/extend')

const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()

// getDocument is added to prototype of Page
const $document = await page.getDocument()
// query methods are added directly to prototype of ElementHandle
const $form = await $document.getByTestId('my-form')
// destructuring works if you explicitly call getQueriesForElement
const {getByLabelText} = $form.getQueriesForElement()
// ...
const $email = await getByLabelText('Email')
```

### API

Unique methods, not part of `DOM Testing Library`.

- `getDocument(page: puppeteer.Page): ElementHandle` - get an ElementHandle for
  the document

### Forwarded methods

`DOM Testing Library` is injected into the page that puppeteer is controlling on
each query, so all results will be async. It's still recommended that you use
puppeteer's built-in methods for interaction rather than `fireEvent`.

## Known Limitations

- `waitForElement` method is not exposed. Puppeteer has its own set of wait
  utilities that somewhat conflict with the style used in `DOM Testing Library`.
  See
  [the issue on GitHub](https://github.com/patrickhulce/pptr-testing-library/issues/3).
- `fireEvent` method is not exposed, use puppeteer's built-ins instead.
- `expect` assertion extensions are not available.
