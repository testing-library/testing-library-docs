This page is intended for developers who have experience with Enzyme and are
trying to understand how to migrate to React Testing Library. It does not go
into great detail about how to migrate all types of tests, but it does have some
helpful information for those who are comparing Enzyme with React Testing
Library.

## What is React Testing Library?

React Testing Library is part of an open-source project named
[Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library). There are several other
helpful tools and libraries in the Testing Library project which you can use to
write more concise and useful tests. Besides React Testing Library, here are
some of the project's other libraries that can help you along the way:

- **[@testing-library/jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)**:
  `jest-dom` provides a set of custom Jest matchers that you can use to extend
  Jest. These make your tests more declarative, clearer to read, and easier to
  maintain.

- **[@testing-library/user-event](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event):**
  `user-event` tries to simulate the real events that happen in the browser as
  the user interacts with elements on the page. For example,
  `userEvent.click(checkbox)` would change the state of the checkbox.

## Why should I use React Testing Library?

Enzyme is a powerful test library, and its contributors did a lot for the
JavaScript community. In fact, many of the React Testing Library maintainers
used and contributed to Enzyme for years before developing and working on React
Testing Library. So we want to say thank you to the contributors of Enzyme!

The primary purpose of React Testing Library is to increase confidence in your
tests by testing your components in the way a user would use them. Users don't
care what happens behind the scenes, they just see and interact with the output.
Instead of accessing the components' internal APIs or evaluating their `state`,
you'll get more confidence by writing your tests based on the component output.

React Testing Library aims to solve the problem that many developers face when
writing tests with Enzyme, which allows (and encourages) developers to test
[implementation details](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details).
Tests which do this ultimately prevent you from modifying and refactoring the
component without changing its tests. As a result, the tests slow down
development speed and productivity. Every small change may require rewriting
some part of your tests, even if the change does not affect the component's
output.

Rewriting your tests in React Testing library is worthwhile because you'll be
trading tests that slow you down for tests that give you more confidence and
increase your productivity in the long run.

## How to migrate from Enzyme to React Testing Library?

To ensure a successful migration, we recommend doing it incrementally by running
the two test libraries side by side in the same application, porting your Enzyme
tests to React Testing Library one by one. That makes it possible to migrate
even large and complex applications without disrupting other business because
the work can be done collaboratively and spread out over time.

## Install React Testing Library

First, install React Testing Library and the `jest-dom` helper library (you can
check [this page](setup.mdx) for the complete installation and setup guide).

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

## Import React Testing Library to your test

If you're using Jest (you can use other test frameworks), then you only need to
import the following modules into your test file:

```jsx
// import React so you can use JSX (React.createElement) in your test
import React from 'react'

/**
 * render: lets us render the component as React would
 * screen: a utility for finding elements the same way the user does
 */
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
```

The test structure can be the same as you would write with Enzyme:

```jsx
test('test title', () => {
  // Your tests come here...
})
```

> Note: you can also use `describe` and `it` blocks with React Testing Library.
> React Testing Library doesn't replace Jest, just Enzyme. We recommend `test`
> because it helps with this:

## Basic Enzyme to React Testing Library migration examples

One thing to keep in mind is that there's not a one-to-one mapping of Enzyme
features to React Testing Library features. Many Enzyme features result in
inefficient tests anyway, so some of the features you're accustomed to with
Enzyme need to be left behind (no more need for a `wrapper` variable or
`wrapper.update()` calls, etc.).

React Testing Library has helpful queries which let you access your component's
elements and their properties. We'll show some typical Enzyme tests along with
alternatives using React Testing Library.

Let's say we have a `Welcome` component which shows a welcome message. We will
have a look at both Enzyme and React Testing Library tests to learn how we can
test this component:

**React Component**

The following component gets a `name` from `props` and shows a welcome message
in an `h1` element. It also has a text input which users can change to a
different name, and the template updates accordingly. Check the live version on
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/ecstatic-hellman-fh7in).

```jsx
const Welcome = props => {
  const [values, setValues] = useState({
    firstName: props.firstName,
    lastName: props.lastName,
  })

  const handleChange = event => {
    setValues({...values, [event.target.name]: event.target.value})
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>
        Welcome, {values.firstName} {values.lastName}
      </h1>

      <form name="userName">
        <label>
          First Name
          <input
            value={values.firstName}
            name="firstName"
            onChange={handleChange}
          />
        </label>

        <label>
          Last Name
          <input
            value={values.lastName}
            name="lastName"
            onChange={handleChange}
          />
        </label>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Welcome
```

### Test 1: Render the component, and check if the `h1` value is correct

**Enzyme test**

```jsx
test('has correct welcome text', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<Welcome firstName="John" lastName="Doe" />)
  expect(wrapper.find('h1').text()).toEqual('Welcome, John Doe')
})
```

**React Testing library**

```jsx
test('has correct welcome text', () => {
  render(<Welcome firstName="John" lastName="Doe" />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('heading')).toHaveTextContent('Welcome, John Doe')
})
```

As you can see, the tests are pretty similar. Enzyme's `shallow` renderer
doesn't render sub-components, so React Testing Library's `render` method is
more similar to Enzyme's `mount` method.

In React Testing Library, you don't need to assign the `render` result to a
variable (i.e. `wrapper`). You can simply access the rendered output by calling
functions on the `screen` object. The other good thing to know is that React
Testing Library automatically cleans up the environment after each test so you
don't need to call `cleanup` in an `afterEach` or `beforeEach` function.

The other thing that you might notice is `getByRole` which has `'heading'` as
its argument. `'heading'` is the accessible role of the `h1` element. You can
learn more about them on the [queries documentation page](queries/byrole.mdx).
One of the things people quickly learn to love about Testing Library is how it
encourages you to write more accessible applications (because if it's not
accessible, then it's harder to test).

### Test 2: Input texts must have correct value

In the component above, the input values are initialized with the
`props.firstName` and `props.lastName` values. We need to check whether the
value is correct or not.

**Enzyme**

```jsx
test('has correct input value', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<Welcome firstName="John" lastName="Doe" />)
  expect(wrapper.find('input[name="firstName"]').value).toEqual('John')
  expect(wrapper.find('input[name="lastName"]').value).toEqual('Doe')
})
```

**React Testing Library**

```jsx
test('has correct input value', () => {
  render(<Welcome firstName="John" lastName="Doe" />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('form')).toHaveFormValues({
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
  })
})
```

Cool! It's pretty simple and handy, and the tests are clear enough that we don't
need to talk much about them. Something that you might notice is that the
`<form>` has a `role="form"` attribute, but what is it?

`role` is one of the accessibility-related attributes that is recommended to use
to improve your web application for people with disabilities. Some elements have
default `role` values and you don't need to set one for them, but some others
like `<div>` do not have default `role` values. You can use different approaches
to access the `<div>` element, but we recommend trying to access elements by
their implicit `role` to make sure your component is accessible by people with
disabilities and those using screen readers. [This section](queries/byrole.mdx)
of the query documentation might help you understand the concepts better.

> A `<form>` element must have a `name` attribute in order to have an implicit
> `role` of `'form'` (as required by the specification).

React Testing Library aims to test the components how users use them. Users see
buttons, headings, forms and other elements by their role, not by their `id`,
`class`, or element tag name. Therefore, when you use React Testing Library you
should avoid accessing the DOM with the `document.querySelector` API. (You _can_
use it in your tests, but it's not recommended for the reasons stated in this
paragraph.)

React Testing Library exposes some handy query APIs which help you access the
component elements efficiently. You can see the
[list of available queries here](queries/about.mdx#types-of-queries). If you're
not sure which query you should use in a given situation, we have a great page
which explains [which query to use](queries/about.mdx#priority), so check it
out!

If you still have a question about which of React Testing Library's queries to
use, then check out [testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com) and
the accompanying Chrome extension
**[Testing Playground](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano)**
which aims to enable developers to find the best query when writing tests. It
also helps you find the best queries to select elements. It allows you to
inspect the element hierarchies in the Chrome Developer Tools and provides you
with suggestions on how to select them, all while encouraging good testing
practices.

## Using act() and wrapper.update()

When testing asynchronous code in Enzyme, you usually need to call `act()` to
run your tests correctly. When using React Testing Library, you don't need to
explicitly call `act()` most of the time because it wraps API calls with `act()`
by default.

`update()` syncs the Enzyme component tree snapshot with the React component
tree, so you may see `wrapper.update()` in Enzyme tests. React Testing Library
does not have (or need) a similar method, which is good for you since you need
to handle fewer things!

## Simulate user events

There are two ways to simulate user events with React Testing Library. One way
is to use the [`user-event`](user-event/intro.mdx) library, and the other way is
to use [`fireEvent`](dom-testing-library/api-events.mdx) which is included in
React Testing Library. `user-event` is actually built on top of `fireEvent`
(which simply calls `dispatchEvent` on the given element). `user-event` is
generally recommended because it ensures that all the events are fired in the
correct order for typical user interactions. This helps ensure your tests
resemble the way your software is actually used.

To use the `@testing-library/user-event` module, first install it:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/dom
```

Now you can import it into your test:

```jsx
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
```

To demonstrate how to use the `user-event` library, imagine we have a `Checkbox`
component which shows a checkbox input and an associated label. We want to
simulate the event of a user clicking the checkbox:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const Checkbox = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="checkbox">Check</label>
      <input id="checkbox" type="checkbox" />
    </div>
  )
}

export default Checkbox
```

We want to test that when a user clicks on the checkbox's associated label, the
input's "checked" property is properly set. Let's see how we might write a test
for that case:

```jsx
test('handles click correctly', async () => {
  render(<Checkbox />)
  const user = userEvent.setup()

  // You can also call this method directly on userEvent,
  // but using the methods from `.setup()` is recommended.
  await user.click(screen.getByText('Check'))

  expect(screen.getByLabelText('Check')).toBeChecked()
})
```

Nice!

### Triggering class methods in tests (`wrapper.instance()`)

As we already discussed, we recommend against testing implementation details and
things that users will not be aware of. We aim to test and interact with the
component more like how our users would.

> If your test uses \`instance()\` or \`state()\`, know that you're testing
> things that the user couldn't possibly know about or even care about, which
> will take your tests further from giving you confidence that things will work
> when your user uses them. —
> [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/why-i-never-use-shallow-rendering#calling-methods-in-react-components)

If you're unsure how to test something internal to your component, then take a
step back and consider: "What would the user do to trigger this code to run?"
Then make your test do that.

### How to `shallow` render a component?

In general, you should avoid mocking out components. However, if you need to,
then try using
[Jest's mocking feature](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/manual-mocks.html). For more
information, see the [FAQ](react-testing-library/faq.mdx).
