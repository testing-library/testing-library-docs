title: Considerations for fireEvent

## Interactions vs. events

Based on [the Guiding Principles](guiding-principles.mdx), your test should
resemble how users interact with your code (component, page, etc.) as much as
possible. With this in mind, you should know that `fireEvent` isn't _exactly_
how the user interacts with your application, but it's close enough for most
scenarios.

Consider `fireEvent.click`, which creates a click event and dispatches that
event on the given DOM node. This works properly for most situations when you
simply want to test what happens when your element is clicked, but when the
_user_ actually clicks your element, these are the events that are typically
fired (in order):

- fireEvent.mouseOver(element)
- fireEvent.mouseMove(element)
- fireEvent.mouseDown(element)
- element.focus() (if that element is focusable)
- fireEvent.mouseUp(element)
- fireEvent.click(element)

And then, if that element happens to be a child of a `label`, then it will also
move focus to the form control that the label is labeling. So even though all
you really are trying to test is the click handler, by simply using
`fireEvent.click` you're missing out on several other potentially important
events the user is firing along the way.

Again, most of the time this isn't critical for your tests and the trade-off of
simply using `fireEvent.click` is worth it.

## Alternatives

We will describe a couple of simple adjustments to your tests that will increase
your confidence in the interactive behavior of your components. For other
interactions you may want to either consider using
[`user-event`](user-event/intro.mdx) or testing your components in a real
environment (e.g. manually, automatic with cypress, etc.).

### Keydown

[A keydown is dispatched on the currently focused element, the body element or the document element](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-keyboard-event-order).
Following this you should prefer

```diff
- fireEvent.keyDown(getByText('click me'));
+ getByText('click me').focus();
+ fireEvent.keyDown(document.activeElement || document.body);
```

This will also test that the element in question can even receive keyboard
events.

### Focus/Blur

If an element is focused, a focus event is dispatched, the active element in the
document changes, and the previously focused element is blurred. To simulate
this behavior you can simply replace `fireEvent` with imperative focus:

```diff
- fireEvent.focus(getByText('focus me'));
+ getByText('focus me').focus();
```

A nice side-effect of this approach is that any assertion on fired focus events
will fail if the element is not focusable. This is especially important if you
follow-up with a keydown event.
