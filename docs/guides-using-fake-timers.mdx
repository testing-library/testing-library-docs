In some cases, when your code uses timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`,
`clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`), your tests may become unpredictable, slow and
flaky.

To solve these problems, or if you need to rely on specific timestamps in your
code, most testing frameworks offer the option to replace the real timers in
your tests with fake ones. This has a side effect - when using fake timers in
your tests, _all_ of the code inside your test uses fake timers.

The common pattern to setup fake timers is usually within the `beforeEach`, for
example:

```js
// Fake timers using Jest
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.useFakeTimers()
})
```

Since fake timers are mocking native timer functions, it is necessary to restore
the timers after your test runs, just like regular mocks. This prevents fake
timers leaking into other test cases and cleanup functions, where real timers
are expected.

For that you usually call `useRealTimers` in `afterEach`.

It's important to also call `runOnlyPendingTimers` before switching to real
timers. This will ensure you flush all the pending timers before you switch to
real timers. If you don't progress the timers and just switch to real timers,
the scheduled tasks won't get executed and you'll get an unexpected behavior.
This is mostly important for 3rd parties that schedule tasks without you being
aware of it.

Here's an example of doing that using jest:

```js
// Running all pending timers and switching to real timers using Jest
afterEach(() => {
  jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()
  jest.useRealTimers()
})
```

:::note

Combining fake timers with `user-event` may cause test timeouts. Refer to
[`advanceTimers`](user-event/options.mdx#advancetimers) option to prevent this
issue.
