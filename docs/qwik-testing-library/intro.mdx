[Qwik Testing Library on GitHub][gh]

[gh]: https://github.com/ianlet/qwik-testing-library

## The Problem

You want to write maintainable tests for your [Qwik][qwik] components.

[qwik]: https://qwik.dev/

## This Solution

The Qwik Testing Library is a lightweight library for testing Qwik components.
It provides functions on top of `qwik` and `@testing-library/dom` so you can
mount Qwik components and query their rendered output in the DOM. Its primary
guiding principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you.][guiding-principle]

**What this library is not**:

1.  A test runner or framework.
2.  Specific to a testing framework.
