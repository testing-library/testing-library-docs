The easiest way to get started with Qwik Testing Library is to use the Qwik CLI
that comes with your Qwik project to automatically set it up for you:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run qwik add testing-library
```

If you prefer to set it up manually or want to understand what the setup script
does, read along...

## Manual Setup

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @noma.to/qwik-testing-library @testing-library/dom
```

This library supports `qwik` versions `1.7.2` and above and
`@testing-library/dom` versions `10.1.0` and above.

You may also be interested in installing `@testing-library/jest-dom` and
`@testing-library/user-event` so you can use [the custom jest
matchers][jest-dom] and [the user event library][user-event] to test
interactions with the DOM.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

Finally, we need a DOM environment to run the tests in. This library was tested
(for now) only with `jsdom` so we recommend using it:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev jsdom
```

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[node]: https://nodejs.org
[jest-dom]: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom
[user-event]: https://github.com/testing-library/user-event

## Vitest Configuration

We recommend using `@noma.to/qwik-testing-library` with [Vitest][vitest] as your
test runner.

If you haven't done so already, add vitest to your project using Qwik CLI:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run qwik add vitest
```

After that, we need to configure Vitest so it can run your tests. For this,
create a _separate_ `vitest.config.ts` so you don't have to modify your
project's `vite.config.ts`:

```ts title="vitest.config.ts"
import {defineConfig, mergeConfig} from 'vitest/config'
import viteConfig from './vite.config'

export default defineConfig(configEnv =>
  mergeConfig(
    viteConfig(configEnv),
    defineConfig({
      // qwik-testing-library needs to consider your project as a Qwik lib
      // if it's already a Qwik lib, you can remove this section
      build: {
        target: 'es2020',
        lib: {
          entry: './src/index.ts',
          formats: ['es', 'cjs'],
          fileName: (format, entryName) =>
            `${entryName}.qwik.${format === 'es' ? 'mjs' : 'cjs'}`,
        },
      },
      // configure your test environment
      test: {
        environment: 'jsdom',
        setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'],
        globals: true,
      },
    }),
  ),
)
```

For now, `qwik-testing-library` needs to consider your project as a lib. Hence,
the `build.lib` section in the config above.

As the build will try to use `./src/index.ts` as the entry point, we need to
create it:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
/**
 * DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE
 *
 * This entrypoint is needed by @noma.to/qwik-testing-library to run your tests
 */
```

Then, create the `vitest.setup.ts` file:

```ts title="vitest.setup.ts"
// Configure DOM matchers to work in Vitest
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest'

// This has to run before qdev.ts loads. `beforeAll` is too late
globalThis.qTest = false // Forces Qwik to run as if it was in a Browser
globalThis.qRuntimeQrl = true
globalThis.qDev = true
globalThis.qInspector = false
```

This setup will make sure that Qwik is properly configured. It also loads
`@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` in your test runner so you can use matchers
like `expect(...).toBeInTheDocument()`.

By default, Qwik Testing Library cleans everything up automatically for you. You
can opt out of this by setting the environment variable `QTL_SKIP_AUTO_CLEANUP`
to `true`. Then in your tests, you can call the `cleanup` function when needed.
For example:

```ts
import {cleanup} from '@noma.to/qwik-testing-library'
import {afterEach} from 'vitest'

afterEach(cleanup)
```

Now, edit your `tsconfig.json` to declare the following global types:

```diff title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": [
+     "vitest/globals",
+     "@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest"
    ]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

[vitest]: https://vitest.dev/

Finally, you can add test scripts to your `package.json` to run the tests with
Vitest

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
    "test:watch": "vitest"
  }
}
```
